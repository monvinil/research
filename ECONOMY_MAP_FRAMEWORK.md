# Economy Map Framework — 5-Year Structural Transformation Projection

## Purpose

This framework projects what the economy **becomes** — not what businesses to build. The output is a map of structural transformation across sectors, geographies, and time horizons, driven by converging forces (AI, demographics, geopolitics, psychology, energy, capital).

The 9 cycles of business model research provide **ground-truth evidence** for sector transformations. When we identified "AI-native accounting is viable at 10x lower cost," that's a data point about how the accounting sector transforms. When we confirmed "staffing stocks crashed 53%," that's evidence of an industry in active structural destruction.

**Previous output**: "These 10 businesses are safe to build."
**New output**: "This is what the economy looks like in 2031."

## Architecture: 4-Layer Economy Map

### Layer 1: MACRO FORCES (What's driving change)

Six force categories, each tracked with leading indicators, velocity, and geographic variation:

#### F1: Technology Forces
- **AI capability curve**: Model performance trajectory, inference cost (50x/yr decline confirmed), reasoning capability, multimodal progress
- **Robotics convergence**: Cobot cost ($25-60K, ROI 6-18mo), dexterity improvements, AI+robotics compound effect
- **Compute economics**: GPU/TPU normalization, edge deployment, energy-per-inference
- **Automation boundary shift**: Where does Polanyi's Paradox (T21) boundary move? What was tacit in 2024 becomes codifiable by 2028?

**Key indicators**: Inference cost per 1M tokens, cobot installations (IFR data), AI benchmark scores by task type, open-source vs frontier gap

#### F2: Demographic Forces
- **Aging economies**: Japan (leading), US/EU (following), workforce shrinkage by occupation
- **Young economies**: India, SEA, Africa — demographic dividend, leapfrog potential
- **Migration patterns**: Talent flows, immigration policy effects on labor supply
- **Education pipeline**: Credential disruption, skills gap widening/narrowing
- **Silver Tsunami**: 52.3% of US employer businesses owned by 55+, succession crisis

**Key indicators**: Dependency ratios by country, occupation age distributions (BLS/O*NET), immigration visa approvals, university enrollment by field

#### F3: Geopolitical Forces
- **US-China decoupling**: Chip controls, parallel AI ecosystems, supply chain bifurcation
- **Reshoring/nearshoring**: Manufacturing localization, LATAM as beneficiary
- **Energy geopolitics**: Iran-Israel tension, Strait of Hormuz, energy transition policy
- **Taiwan semiconductor risk**: TSMC concentration, hardware-light advantage
- **Trade bloc formation**: US-aligned vs China-aligned technology stacks
- **Regulatory divergence**: EU AI Act, China AI regulations, US sector-specific, India's approach

**Key indicators**: Trade flow data (USTR), reshoring index (Kearney), chip export control scope, bilateral technology agreements

#### F4: Capital & Financial Forces
- **Interest rate regime**: High-rate environment favoring cash-flow businesses
- **PE/VC allocation shifts**: From pure-digital to hard-tech, robotics, physical economy
- **Sovereign wealth movements**: SoftBank Vision, Saudi PIF, Mubadala sector bets
- **Refinancing wall**: $1.2T PE debt maturing 2027-2029 (T15)
- **Liquidation dynamics**: Bankruptcy rates, distressed M&A, asset repricing
- **Perez cycle position**: Installation→Deployment transition, potential crash timing (T5)

**Key indicators**: Fed Funds rate, HY spreads, VC fund formation by thesis, sovereign wealth allocation reports, PE deal multiples by sector, IPO window

#### F5: Psychology & Sentiment Forces (NEW)
- **AI anxiety index**: Public fear of AI displacement, trust in AI decisions
- **Adoption resistance by sector**: Where does psychological resistance slow adoption regardless of economics?
- **Consumer confidence trajectory**: Overall spending willingness, sector-specific confidence
- **CEO/executive confidence**: Willingness to invest in transformation vs. hunker down
- **Regulatory fear**: Industries where regulation driven by fear rather than evidence
- **Status quo bias measurement**: Switching costs are psychological, not just economic (T14)
- **Trust premium**: Willingness-to-pay for "verified human" in AI-saturated markets (T19, T3 Category B)

**Key indicators**:
- University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index
- CEO Confidence Survey (Conference Board)
- Edelman Trust Barometer (AI-specific)
- Pew Research AI sentiment surveys
- VIX (financial fear)
- AAII Investor Sentiment Survey
- Google Trends: "AI replacing jobs", "AI anxiety", "AI safety"
- Industry-specific NPS/satisfaction before and after AI adoption

#### F6: Energy & Resource Forces
- **Energy cost trajectory**: AI compute energy demand vs renewable cost curves
- **Critical minerals**: Supply chain concentration, recycling technology
- **Water stress**: Data center cooling, agricultural water competition
- **Climate policy**: Carbon pricing, renewable mandates, transition subsidies

**Key indicators**: EIA energy projections, IEA World Energy Outlook, critical mineral prices, water stress indices

   For each of the 6 force categories:
   - What changed since last cycle?
   - Velocity: accelerating / steady / decelerating / reversing
   - New data points
   - Updated projections

2. SECTOR TRANSFORMATION UPDATES
   For each priority sector:
   - New evidence (confirming/contradicting transformation path)
   - Timeline adjustments (earlier/later than projected)
   - Second-order effects observed
   - Geographic variation updates

3. GEOGRAPHIC UPDATES
   For each priority geography:
   - Policy changes
   - Capital flow shifts
   - Adoption rate updates
   - Sentiment/psychology shifts

4. EMERGENT ECONOMY OBSERVATIONS
   - New categories appearing
   - New firm structures observed
   - New labor roles emerging
   - Capital structure innovations

5. CROSS-LAYER INTERACTIONS
   - How force changes affect sector projections
   - How geographic differences create divergent paths
   - How emergent economy categories change sector definitions
   - Feedback loops: where transformation in one sector drives transformation in another

6. CONFIDENCE ADJUSTMENTS
   - Which projections got more confident (new confirming evidence)
   - Which got less confident (counter-evidence or surprises)
   - New unknowns identified
   - Assumptions that were validated or invalidated
```

## Theoretical Lenses (Preserved from v2)

All 24 theoretical lenses from ANALYTICAL_FRAMEWORK.md remain operational. They shift from "which businesses to build" to "how sectors transform":

| Theory | Economy Map Application |
|--------|----------------------|
| T1 Schumpeter | Predicts which sectors face accelerated destruction cycles |
| T3 Baumol | Identifies sectors with stored disruption energy (Cure) and rising human premium (Premium) |
| T4 Minsky | Predicts where financial structures collapse under AI pressure |
| T5 Perez | Times the Installation→Deployment transition, predicts potential crash |
| T6 Jevons | Projects market expansion at lower price points (total economy growth from AI) |
| T8 Demographics | Maps labor supply curves to zero by occupation and geography |
| T10 Coase | Predicts firm size evolution across sectors |
| T14 Prospect Theory | Predicts adoption resistance by sector (psychology layer) |
| T21 Polanyi | Classifies work as automatable vs human-premium (the Barbell Economy) |
| T22 AGG Prediction | Projects the prediction-judgment split across professions |
| T24 Robotics × AI | Projects physical production transformation path |

### NEW Theoretical Addition: T25 — Fear Economics

**Theory**: Economic transformation is not purely rational. Fear of displacement, loss aversion (T14), status quo bias, and institutional resistance (T17) create predictable delays and distortions in the adoption curve. Fear-driven policy (AI regulation, licensing protection, union action) can accelerate or decelerate sector transformation by years.

**Application**: For each sector transformation, model the **psychology friction** — the gap between "economically optimal adoption" and "actual adoption" driven by fear, trust, and institutional resistance.

```
FEAR FRICTION MODEL:

SECTOR: [Name]
├── Economic readiness: [1-10] (how viable is AI transformation?)
├── Psychological readiness: [1-10] (how willing are stakeholders?)
├── GAP: [economic - psychological] = fear friction
│
├── Fear drivers:
│   ├── Worker displacement fear: [low/medium/high]
│   ├── Customer trust barrier: [low/medium/high]
│   ├── Regulatory fear response: [none/emerging/active]
│   ├── Institutional resistance: [low/medium/high]
│   └── Media narrative: [positive/neutral/negative]
│
├── Friction resolution path:
│   ├── What triggers adoption despite fear? [labor shortage, cost crisis, competitor defection]
│   ├── Expected resolution timeline: [years]
│   └── Resolution mechanism: [crisis-driven / gradual / regulatory-mandated]
│
└── Fear as opportunity:
    ├── Fear-driven demand: [cybersecurity, AI safety, compliance, insurance]
    ├── Trust premium services: [human verification, audit, certification]
    └── Counter-narrative businesses: [tools that reduce fear, increase transparency]
```

## Relationship to Previous Work

The 9 cycles of business model research become **evidence inputs** to the economy map:

| Previous Output | Economy Map Input |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 522 business models constructed | Evidence for sector transformation paths |
| 28 running patterns confirmed | Structural forces with empirical backing |
| Staffing canary (RHI -53%) | Real-time transformation velocity indicator |
| Financial cascade (accounting -49K YoY) | Confirmed sector destruction in progress |
| Zero-density gaps (wholesale, printing, food) | Sectors where transformation hasn't been noticed yet |
| Silver Tsunami (52.3% of businesses owned by 55+) | Demographic force with NAICS-level granularity |
| NAICS systematic screening (293 4-digit industries) | Bottom-up sector structure baseline |
| Architecture types + scores | Predict which firm structures survive transformation |
| Polanyi work classification | Predict which roles survive vs transform vs disappear |
| Robotics × AI compound effect | Physical production transformation trajectory |

**Business models are now footnotes, not the main output.** When we say "accounting is transforming," the 15+ accounting business models we constructed are evidence of *how* it transforms — not recommendations for what to build.

## Success Criteria

The economy map is useful when it can answer:

1. **"What does [sector X] look like in 2031?"** — Employment level, firm structure, cost structure, dominant business model, new roles, eliminated roles
2. **"How does transformation differ between [region A] and [region B]?"** — Geographic variation driven by demographics, regulation, AI access, culture
3. **"What are the second-order effects of [transformation Y]?"** — Cascading effects across supply chains, labor markets, adjacent sectors
4. **"What new economic categories emerge?"** — Things that don't exist today but will be significant in 2031
5. **"Where does fear/psychology delay or distort the transformation?"** — The gap between economic readiness and actual adoption
6. **"What's the confidence level and what could invalidate this projection?"** — Honest uncertainty acknowledgment with specific falsification criteria

---

## Stated Limitations

### Stated Limitation: Transformation ≠ Welfare

This engine predicts the *likelihood and speed of economic transformation*, not whether that transformation improves human welfare. Validated in Experiment 2 (v3-17): when the 5 T-axes were applied to 35 countries and compared against ground truth (HDI, World Happiness Report, Legatum Prosperity Index), transformation scores correlated with *disruption pressure* — not with prosperity, happiness, or institutional quality. Countries with the highest engine scores (India, Philippines, Vietnam) are under the most transformation pressure but have lower welfare outcomes than stable countries (Norway, Switzerland, Finland) that score low because their economies face less disruption.

**Implication**: A high T-score means "this sector/model is being transformed" — not "this transformation is beneficial." The engine has no "already good" axis. Users should interpret high scores as *probability of change*, not *quality of outcome*.
