The 330 kt deficit means there is literally not enough refined copper being produced to meet current demand. Data centers are now a material demand driver (475 kt is equivalent to the copper consumption of a mid-sized country). The deficit widening from 304 kt to 330 kt despite high prices suggests supply cannot respond fast enough — mining projects take 7-10 years from discovery to production.
