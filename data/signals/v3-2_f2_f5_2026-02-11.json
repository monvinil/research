If AI adoption in these sectors requires navigating complex trust/compliance/ethics barriers, then first movers who build trust credibility gain durable competitive advantages. The fear friction that slows adoption also raises barriers to entry for competitors. This is the core v3 insight about F5: psychology determines not just adoption SPEED but also competitive STRUCTURE. High-fear sectors adopt slowly but create stronger moats for first movers.",
