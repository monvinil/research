When society cannot form consensus on whether a technology is beneficial or harmful, adoption decisions become paralyzed. The experience gap (users optimistic, non-users fearful) confirms the v3-7 Edelman finding that trust is experience-driven. But the 50/50 global split means the AI trust problem is not solvable by education alone — half the population has heard the arguments and still concludes AI destroys jobs. Policy and institutional frameworks must address this structural ambiguity.",
