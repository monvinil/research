The 'job hugging' phenomenon (64% staying put out of fear) is the inverse of the Great Resignation — workers are now frozen rather than mobile. This has profound implications: labor market fluidity drops, reducing allocative efficiency; workers accept suboptimal conditions rather than risk job transitions; and innovation adoption at the firm level is constrained by workforce resistance. The 56% receiving no training is the mechanism — organizations are deploying AI tools without investing in human readiness, creating the exact fear response the tools are designed to reduce.",
