Developers: 46% don't trust AI output, only 3% 'highly trust.' Enterprise: <35% achieve measurable ROI despite 70-80% adoption. Agentic AI: 40% of projects predicted to fail by 2027. Healthcare: 34-point trust gap between providers and patients. The binding constraint on AI economic impact is NOT capability (models are good enough for most tasks at current prices) but rather: (1) trust infrastructure (verification, explainability, audit trails), (2) integration capability (connecting AI to legacy systems), and (3) organizational change management. This trust deficit is not a bug — it's a market. The $86B 'fear economy' (governance $15.8B + safety $9.8B + cybersecurity $60.6B) identified in v3-2 should be upgraded as the trust gap widens even as adoption deepens.",
