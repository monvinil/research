      "detail": "The higher education 'demographic cliff' is now hitting. Experts project a 15%+ decline in traditional college-age students enrolling in higher education over the next decade, driven by declining birth rates from the late 2000s and early 2010s. 57% of polled colleges reported a decline in international enrollment during fall 2025, compounding the domestic decline. The number of high school graduates is expected to decline steadily for at least the next decade. This has cascading implications for every professional pipeline tracked in F2 signals: fewer college students means fewer potential CPA candidates (already at 1.4% of students), fewer nursing students (already 65K turned away from capacity-constrained programs), fewer teaching candidates (already in crisis), and fewer STEM graduates for manufacturing. Small, tuition-dependent institutions with limited endowments face existential risk. The education cliff is the upstream demographic force that feeds ALL downstream pipeline collapses. The AICPA specifically warns that 'broader demographic trends, including an expected decline in high-school graduates over the next decade, mean that even a stabilized or slightly growing accounting pipeline will require continuous outreach and innovation.'",

This is demographic lag made visible. T3 Baumol: Higher education is itself a Baumol institution (costs rising faster than value delivered for many students), which accelerates the enrollment decline as students rationally question ROI.
