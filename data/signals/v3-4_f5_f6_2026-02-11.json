Over 160 new AI data centers have been built in water-scarce US regions in the past 3 years, with 30% of projects under construction in areas where water scarcity will intensify. In Phoenix, approximately 60 data centers consume 177 million gallons per day — competing directly with agricultural water allocations. Farmers are criticizing large investor-owned utilities for profiting from data center investments at agricultural expense. Larger data centers consume up to 5 million gallons per day (equivalent to a town of 10,000-50,000 people). The industry response is accelerating advanced cooling (direct-to-chip liquid cooling, immersion cooling) which can reduce cooling power 50-60%, but local regulators are now mandating dry or hybrid cooling methods and recycled water use.",
