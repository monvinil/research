At $150-$400/hr for professional legal work and $200-$500/hr for CPA firms, these services are priced out of reach for most of the 33.2M US small businesses. If AI reduces the cost of delivering equivalent service by 10x (from $200/hr to $20/hr equivalent), T6 predicts 3-5x TAM expansion. The addressable market isn't just the firms currently buying these services — it's the 70% who cannot afford them today.",
