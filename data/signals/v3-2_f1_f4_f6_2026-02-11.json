This removes the critical mineral cost constraint that was expected to slow battery deployment and EV adoption. Battery costs at $115/kWh (2024) projected to reach $80/kWh by 2027, and the lithium surplus ensures the raw material input cost will not reverse this trajectory. The structural implication: energy storage becomes cheap enough to pair with solar for near-24/7 power at costs competitive with natural gas in many locations. For the AI energy constraint (Signal 018), battery storage partially addresses the intermittency problem for solar-powered data centers. The binding constraint shifts from mineral supply to manufacturing capacity for batteries and grid infrastructure for deployment.",
