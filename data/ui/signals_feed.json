      "detail": "Mental health AI market update: Talkspace partnering with Novo Nordisk for Wegovy patients, launching full AI product H1 2026. Slingshot AI raised $93M for AI-powered therapy. MindSync at $720M/$250M Series D/8M users. The MARKET is massive but the TOOL LAYER (therapist documentation) is crowding fast (Blueprint 50K clinicians, Mentalyc, TheraPro, Berries, Supanote). Best mental health plays are at EMPLOYER level (EAP replacement) or REGULATORY level (state compliance), not consumer or tool layer."
