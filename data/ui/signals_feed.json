This is enterprise-focused deployment. IMPLICATION: Large insurers will adopt AI through Microsoft/Cognizant partnerships. The SMB/TPA opportunity remains: 1,200+ TPAs and mid-market insurers that can't afford enterprise deployments need AI-as-a-service for claims."

(3) John Deere, CNH, AGCO spending billions on precision ag R&D. Deere's See & Spray already commercial. (4) Equipment-as-a-service requires large capital outlay for fleet. (5) Farmer adoption is SLOW -- trust in new technology takes years. IMPLICATION: Precision ag is a LONGER timeline opportunity than services plays. OEM competition is the biggest threat. The niche is specialty crops (almonds, grapes, tomatoes) where OEMs underserve."
