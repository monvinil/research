  "summary": "Cycle 11 is the first Business Rotation Engine cycle. A systematic 6-channel scan of the US economy screened 42 candidates, quick-killed 25, parked 6, and killed 2 (Dental K-008, Consulting K-009). Zero new opportunities promoted to INVESTIGATE_FURTHER. Agent C characterizes this as 'strongest possible validation' of the pipeline. Agent B reclassifies: the rotation engine uses the same analytical framework that built the pipeline, so finding no better alternatives is a CONSISTENCY CHECK, not INDEPENDENT VALIDATION (P-012 pattern). Customer Support PURSUE maintained at 72 (flat). Veterinary INVESTIGATE_FURTHER maintained at 62 (Agent B reverses Agent C's +1 cross-channel validation -- same underlying data, not independent signal). Wholesale Trade PARKED by Agent B at 50 (down from 53) -- three cycles without customer discovery, PARK WARNING default triggered. The engine is now definitively in Phase 2 execution support mode. The most valuable rotation engine outputs were methodological: Baumol scanner bias identification, P-010 domain specificity refinement, three-layer framework validation (0% kill rescue rate), and failure archaeology confirming IO propagation chain entry sequence.",
