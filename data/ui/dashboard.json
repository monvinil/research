  "summary": "Cycle 9 brought the engine's most significant methodological advance (bottom-up sector screener producing 3 new candidates from 933 sectors) and its most sobering assessment: the engine has never produced a PURSUE verdict. Of 6 opportunity clusters verified, 3 survived as INVESTIGATE_FURTHER and 3 were PARKED. LATAM Nearshoring parked after 3 cycles of failed differentiation from BPO incumbents — LATAM talent reframed as competitive advantage for Customer Support Vacuum, not standalone opportunity. Boutique Consulting parked for K-002 proximity (trust/relationship sale barrier). Dental parked for regulatory barriers and poor founder fit. Customer Support Vacuum remains #1 with strongest multi-dimensional thesis support but OVERDUE service layer density verification. Veterinary remains #2 with unique sparse density but OVERDUE Mars/IDEXX threat assessment. Wholesale Trade AI Broker is the genuine novel discovery — pure Coasean intermediation target — but needs K-004 distinction test. The engine must RESOLVE OR DECIDE in Cycle 10: either answer the overdue questions or make a judgment call with incomplete information. Analysis paralysis is now a greater risk than making a wrong decision.",
