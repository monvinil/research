  "summary": "Cycle 10 delivers the engine's first actionable output after 10 cycles of rigorous filtering. Customer Support Vacuum Filler — AI-first managed support for SaaS mid-market — advances to PURSUE at score 72 (Agent B adjusted from Agent C's 75). Three non-negotiable research questions resolved: service layer density confirmed sparse (<$500M), Mars/IDEXX confirmed not building vet practice ops AI, and wholesale vs freight distinction convincing on 4/6 dimensions. Triple convergence from independently-derived analytical lenses (Beveridge structural mismatch + staffing canary equity collapse + timing arbitrage vacuum) provides the strongest cross-signal reinforcement the engine has measured. The PURSUE is conditional: must start building within 30 days, first client within 90 days. Veterinary Services advances to 62 (approaching PURSUE, needs customer discovery). Wholesale Trade at 53 with PARK WARNING (needs customer discovery or parks by Cycle 12). The engine's 10-cycle journey — from score-87 naivety through counter-signal revolution and competitive density massacre to this carefully-justified PURSUE — demonstrates both analytical rigor and eventual decisiveness.",
