The counter-signal research did exactly what it was designed to do: stress-tested our top 3 opportunities against reality and found 2 fatally flawed and 1 competitively untenable. This is not a failure — this is the engine working correctly. The Principles Engine successfully identified WHERE disruption is happening (professional services cascade, healthcare shortage, SMB overhead crisis). What it did not capture — and what Cycle 6 corrects — is the competitive landscape and regulatory environment that determine whether WE can be the disruptors. The kill index is now populated with 2 entries, both carrying a critical lesson: the PROBLEM is always valid when the Principles Engine flags it, but the SOLUTION must be tested against who else has already seen the same opportunity. Cycle 7 must apply the proven analytical framework to sectors where PE and well-funded startups have NOT yet arrived. The strongest remaining signals are Construction AI Coordinator (untested for competitive density) and the P7 Timing Arbitrage pattern (confirmed but needs sector-level identification). The framework works — we just need to point it at less crowded terrain.",
