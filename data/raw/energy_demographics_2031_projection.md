# Energy, Resources & Global Demographics for AI-Driven Economic Transformation
## Research Compilation for 2031 Economy Mapping | Data as of February 2026

---

## 1. AI ENERGY DEMAND

### Current Consumption
- **Global data center electricity**: ~415 TWh in 2024 (~1.5% of global electricity consumption)
- **US data centers**: 183 TWh in 2024
- **AI-optimized servers**: 93 TWh in 2025, representing 21% of total data center power usage

### Growth Projections
| Year | Global DC Consumption | AI Share | Source |
|------|----------------------|----------|--------|
| 2024 | 415 TWh | ~15% | IEA |
| 2025 | 448 TWh | 21% | Gartner |
| 2026 | 650-1,050 TWh | ~25% est. | Multiple |
| 2030 | 945-980 TWh | 44% (432 TWh) | IEA/Gartner |

- AI-optimized server electricity usage rising nearly **5x** from 93 TWh (2025) to 432 TWh (2030)
- Global DC power demand growing **175% by 2030 vs 2023** -- equivalent to adding another top-10 power-consuming country
- Gartner: electricity demand for data centers to grow 16% in 2025 and **double by 2030**

### Tech Company Energy Commitments
- **Microsoft**: 20-year nuclear PPA with Constellation Energy to restart Three Mile Island Unit by 2028; large renewable deals
- **Google**: First US corporate SMR fleet deal with Kairos Power (500MW, 6-7 reactors, first by 2030); $4.75B acquisition of Intersect (clean energy developer + DC infrastructure)
- **Amazon**: $20B+ converting Susquehanna to AI campus; $500M financing for X-energy SMRs (5 GW total by 2039); ~$50B committed to AI-focused data centers
- **Meta**: RFP for 1-4 GW new nuclear generation

### Is Energy a Constraint?
**YES -- it is currently the primary bottleneck for AI deployment.**

- Grid-connection queue timelines in hotspots (e.g., Virginia) stretch to **7 years**
- Projected power shortfall of **over 45 GW** for data center demand
- Four compounding factors: technical complexity of high-capacity feeds, upstream grid capacity shortfalls, lengthy lead times for electrical equipment, slow/inconsistent permitting
- Power has become the **first priority in site selection**, surpassing capital and construction as the binding constraint
- Operators increasingly turning to behind-the-meter "Bring Your Own Power" (BYOP) strategies
- Texas passed SB-6 in 2025 redefining interconnection processes for large loads (>75 MW)

**2031 Implication**: Energy is a structural constraint that will determine the pace and geography of AI deployment. Regions that solve power access fastest (through nuclear, dedicated renewables, or BYOP) gain durable competitive advantage. This creates a Ricardian rent dynamic around power-advantaged locations.

## 2. RENEWABLE ENERGY COST CURVES

### Solar LCOE
- **2025 global best**: $37/MWh (single-axis tracker, Middle East/Africa) -- most cost-competitive power generation source globally
- **2025 US utility-scale**: $38-78/MWh (tightening from $29-92/MWh range in 2024)
- **Fixed-axis solar**: Expected to fall to $0.035/kWh ($35/MWh) in 2025
- **Grid-scale solar LCOE**: Dropping ~2% globally per year

### Wind LCOE
- **2025 onshore**: $37-86/MWh (US)
- **Trajectory**: Onshore wind LCOE falling 16% through the 2020s, from $67.6/MWh (2024) to $56.7/MWh (2030)
- Offshore wind remains more expensive but declining

### Battery Storage Costs
- **Utility-scale 4-hour storage**: Falling below $100/MWh by 2026, then another 35% decline by 2060
- Key drivers: lower-than-expected EV demand causing cell oversupply, increased cell capacity and energy density
- Sharp declines across both hybrid and standalone storage projects

### Long-term Trajectory
- BloombergNEF expects **22-49% drop in LCOE by 2035** across clean technologies
- Research shows cost forecasts for solar, wind, and batteries are consistently **too pessimistic** -- actual costs are declining faster than projected
- Trade barriers and protectionism could temporarily stall declines

**2031 Implication**: By 2031, solar+storage will be unambiguously the cheapest electricity source globally. This creates a Jevons paradox dynamic: cheaper energy expands total energy demand rather than merely substituting. The intersection of cheap renewables and AI compute demand creates a positive feedback loop -- more AI deployment becomes economically viable, driving more energy demand, driving more renewable buildout. The constraint shifts from energy cost to energy infrastructure (grid, transmission, storage).

## 3. CRITICAL MINERALS

### Price Trends
| Mineral | Trend | Key Data |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Lithium | Crashed | Surged 8x (2021-22), then fell **>80%** since 2023 |
| Cobalt | Volatile | Down 10-20% in 2024; elevated in 2026 due to DRC export ban |
| Nickel | Down | Dropped 10-20% in 2024 |
| Graphite | Down | Dropped 10-20% in 2024 |
| Rare Earths | Geopolitically constrained | China export controls (Oct 2025) on terbium, dysprosium |
| Copper | Tightening | Entering structural deficit; projected 19M metric ton shortfall by 2050 |

### Demand Projections to 2040
- **Lithium**: 5x growth from current levels
- **Graphite & Nickel**: Demand doubles
- **Cobalt & Rare Earths**: 50-60% growth
- Demand driven primarily by EVs, battery storage, renewables, grid networks

### Supply Chain Concentration Risks
- Geographic concentration of refining has **increased** across nearly all critical minerals
- DRC dominates cobalt mining; Indonesia dominates nickel; China dominates graphite and rare earth refining
- **China announced export controls on REE supplies** and products containing magnets (October 2025)
- Investment in critical mineral development weakened in 2024 (spending up only 5%, down from 14% in 2023)

### Supply Deficits
- **Lithium**: Expected mined supply from announced projects falls short of 2035 demand by ~40%
- **Copper**: Structural deficit beginning, 19M metric ton projected shortfall by 2050

**2031 Implication**: Critical minerals create a two-speed world for hardware costs. Lithium oversupply (from the 2021-22 boom) is keeping battery costs low near-term, but structural deficits emerge by ~2030-2035. Copper is the more immediate constraint. China's chokehold on rare earth refining creates geopolitical risk for robotics and electronics hardware. This favors businesses that can reduce mineral intensity, develop recycling/recovery operations, or secure supply chain positions.

## 4. WATER STRESS

### Data Center Water Consumption
- **Texas data centers**: Projected to use 49 billion gallons in 2025 (~0.4% of statewide water use)
- **US national**: Data centers directly withdraw 107 million gallons/day, consuming ~60% of that (primarily for cooling)
- **Indirect water footprint**: 211 billion gallons in 2023 at power plants supporting data centers -- **~10x direct on-site consumption**
- Roughly **two-thirds of data centers built since 2022** are located in water-stressed regions

### Regional Hotspots
- Data center growth could increase water stress in already strained basins by **up to 17% annually**
- Consumption is concentrated in specific watersheds even when small at the state level
- Texas, Virginia, and arid Southwest are key tension zones

### Policy Response: Weak and Inconsistent
- **California vetoed** Assembly Bill 93 (Oct 2025) that would have required water use disclosure by data center operators
- Data centers are **not consistently required to disclose** water consumption, cooling tech, or expansion plans
- No federal water reporting mandate for data centers exists
- Major cloud providers (Microsoft, AWS) advancing voluntary "water positive" initiatives

**2031 Implication**: Water is an under-priced externality that will increasingly constrain data center siting. Expect regulatory intervention by 2028-2030 as competition between data centers and agriculture intensifies. Businesses that develop water-efficient cooling technologies, closed-loop cooling systems, or enable data center operations in water-abundant regions gain structural advantage.

## 5. GLOBAL DEMOGRAPHIC PROJECTIONS

### 5.1 JAPAN
- **Population (Jan 2026)**: ~125.8 million, declining ~0.12%/year (-149K people/year)
- **Daily population decline**: ~407 persons/day (2026)
- **Working-age population**: Declined 16% from peak of 87.3M (1995) to 73.7M (2024)
- **Working-age projection**: **-31% from 2023 to 2060**
- **Old-age dependency ratio**: Doubled from 21% (1995) to 49% (2024); projected to reach 74% by 2060
- **Total dependency ratio**: 56.2% (2025)
- **Unemployment**: Holding steady at 2.5% (2025-2026) -- effectively full employment
- **Foreign population**: Growing 10% YoY, now ~3% of total population
- **Natural increase**: Deaths exceed births by ~218K/year; net migration +69K partially offsetting

**2031 Implication**: Japan is the world's most acute demographic laboratory. By 2031, working-age population will have fallen to ~68M (from 73.7M today). The country must achieve either massive automation adoption or significant immigration expansion -- likely both. Businesses that solve Japan's care economy, labor automation, or elder-tech needs have a template exportable to every aging economy within 5-15 years.

### 5.2 UNITED STATES
- **Population growth (2025)**: Only 0.5% (1.8M people) -- slowest since early COVID
- **Immigration collapse**: Net international migration dropped from 2.7M to 1.3M (July 2024-June 2025); some estimates show decline to ~500K in 2025
- **US-born working-age population**: Shrinking in every year for the next decade; without immigration, US working-age population would have started declining in 2012
- **Immigration = 100% of population growth**: CBO forecasts immigration accounts for all US population growth, and >100% after 2031
- **Age 65+ share**: 12.4% (2007) -> 17.9% (2024) -> **21.2% by 2035**
- **Silver Tsunami**: Accelerating, with aging population + reduced immigration creating dual pressure on labor supply
- **Labor market implication**: Output growth must rely more heavily on **productivity gains** rather than labor force expansion

**2031 Implication**: The US faces a historically unprecedented situation: the native-born working-age population is shrinking while immigration (the sole source of growth) is being curtailed. By 2031, this creates intense pressure for AI/automation adoption across sectors. Industries most dependent on immigrant labor (agriculture, construction, hospitality, elder care) face the most acute disruption.

### 5.3 EUROPEAN UNION
- **Working-age population (15-64)**: 285.5M (2022) -> declining; EU losing ~1M workers/year until 2050
- **Working-age share**: Projected to fall from 63.9% (2022) to 54.4% (2100)
- **Without migration**: EU population shrinks ~9% by 2050
- **Age 65+ share**: 21.1% (2022) -> projected 32.5% (2100)
- **Regional divergence**: Eastern/Southern EU face sharpest declines; France and Ireland least affected
- **22 of 27 EU countries** will see working-age population declines by 2050
- **85+ population**: Will more than double across the EU

**2031 Implication**: Europe's demographic decline is slower than Japan's but broader. The EU's regulatory environment (AI Act, labor protections) may slow automation adoption even as demographic pressure intensifies. Eastern Europe faces the most severe labor shortages, creating opportunity for nearshoring combined with automation.

### 5.4 CHINA
- **Population peak**: 1.4 billion (2022), now declining for 3 consecutive years (-4.3M total)
- **Fertility rate**: 1.12 children/woman (2021) -- among world's lowest
- **UN projection**: Population falls to 1.26B by 2050, **halves to 633M by 2100**
- **Age 65+ share**: 14.9% (2025) -> **26.3% by 2050**
- **Old-age dependency ratio**: 0.21 (2024) -> 0.52 by 2050 (more than doubles)
- **Worker-to-retiree ratio**: 5:1 now -> 4:1 by 2030 -> **2:1 by 2050**
- **Working-age population**: Peaked 2015, facing **28% decrease by 2050**
- **One-child policy legacy**: Birth rates dropped further after relaxation (1.77 in 2016 -> 1.12 in 2021)

**2031 Implication**: China faces a demographic headwind that will compound through 2031 and beyond. The worker-to-retiree ratio hitting 4:1 by 2030 creates massive fiscal pressure. China's aggressive push into AI and robotics is partly a demographic necessity, not just an industrial strategy. By 2031, China's automation adoption rate will be among the world's highest out of structural need.

### 5.5 INDIA
- **Median age**: 29.8 years (youngest major economy)
- **Age structure**: 24.2% under 15 | 68.4% working-age (15-64) | 7.4% elderly (65+)
- **42.4% of population under 25**
- **Working-age growth**: Adding ~183M working-age people between 2020-2050
- **Global workforce contribution**: 22% of global workforce growth over next 30 years
- **New workforce entrants**: ~12M young people join annually
- **Youth employment challenge**: >70% of youth lack job-relevant skills; only 20-30% of engineering grads find suitable employment
- **Labor force participation**: 50.2% (PLFS 2023-24)
- **Demographic dividend window**: Peak lasts until ~2055; dependency ratio hits lowest point (31.2%) by 2030

**2031 Implication**: India's demographic dividend is the mirror image of China/Japan/EU's aging crisis. By 2031, India will be the world's largest supplier of new workers. The critical question is whether its education and skills infrastructure can match labor supply to AI-era demand. The 70% skills-gap figure suggests massive opportunity for AI-enabled education, vocational training, and credential platforms targeting India's youth.

### 5.6 LATIN AMERICA & CARIBBEAN
- **Total population (2024)**: 663 million (3.8% below projections made in 2000)
- **Urbanization**: 82% urban (vs. 58% global average) -- one of the world's most urbanized regions
- **Labor force (2024)**: 332M total, 274M in urban areas
- **Urban labor force projection**: Growing to 337M by 2050
- **Rural labor force**: Stagnating, expected to flatline
- **Growth rate**: Population growing at 6M people/year, decelerating
- **Demographic transition**: Fertility rate reductions accelerating; population aging accelerating
- **Peak population**: Region expected to peak by 2058

**2031 Implication**: LATAM is in mid-transition -- still growing but decelerating. Extreme urbanization (82%) creates concentrated markets for digital services. The rural stagnation suggests agricultural automation opportunity. LATAM's demographic window is narrower than India's but more immediate than Africa's.

### 5.7 AFRICA
- **Current population**: ~1.5 billion
- **2050 projection**: 2.5-2.7 billion (one quarter of world's projected population)
- **Youth bulge**: Estimated 830M aged 15-35 by 2050
- **Urbanization**: 100+ African cities with 1M+ inhabitants by 2025; massive urbanization wave continuing
- **Mobile internet**: 46% penetration today; smartphones expected to reach 65% by end of 2026
- **Rural internet**: Under 10%
- **Digital skills**: Only 10-15% of youth receive structured digital training
- **Growth sectors**: Fintech, digital services, logistics, renewables, agribusiness, creative industries

**2031 Implication**: Africa is the only continent with explosive working-age population growth through mid-century. The digital leapfrog pattern (mobile-first, skipping legacy infrastructure) creates unique opportunities for AI-native services. The 65% smartphone penetration by 2026 is the enabling infrastructure. The binding constraints are rural connectivity (under 10%), digital skills (10-15% trained), and institutional capacity. By 2031, Africa's urban youth population will be the world's largest untapped market for AI-enabled services.

## 6. LABOR FORCE PROJECTIONS

### Global Net Job Impact by 2030 (WEF Future of Jobs 2025)
- **170 million new jobs created** (14% of today's total employment)
- **92 million jobs displaced** (8% of total employment)
- **Net growth: +78 million jobs** (7% of today's total employment)
- **22% of all jobs** will be disrupted by 2030
- **39% of current skills** will be obsolete by 2030
- **59% of workers** will not receive adequate training

### Fastest-Growing Roles (by growth rate)
1. Big Data Specialists
2. FinTech Engineers
3. AI and Machine Learning Specialists
4. Software and Applications Developers
5. Security Management Specialists
6. Autonomous/Electric Vehicle Specialists
7. Environmental/Renewable Energy Engineers

### Fastest-Growing Roles (by absolute number)
1. Farmworkers (+35M jobs by 2030)
2. Delivery Drivers
3. Construction Workers
4. Care Economy Workers
5. Education Roles

### Fastest-Declining Roles
1. Clerical roles / Administrative Assistants
2. Graphic Designers
3. Data Entry Clerks
4. Postal Service Workers

### Sector-Level Automation Impact
- **Insurance, Pensions, Telecom**: >95% of human standalone task reduction from deeper automation
- **Manufacturing and Administration**: Routine tasks most at risk
- AI could create **97 million new roles** in data science, green tech, and personalized services by 2030 if reskilling is prioritized

### ILO Global Employment Assessment
- Up to **40% of jobs** could be affected by AI (affected, not eliminated)
- Global unemployment rate stable at ~5% but masking structural shifts
- Key challenge: matching displaced workers to new roles across geography and skills

**2031 Implication**: The labor market by 2031 will be defined by polarization. High-growth roles (AI, data, green tech) will face talent shortages while displaced clerical/administrative workers lack pathways to transition. The care economy and frontline roles grow in absolute terms but face automation pressure on specific tasks. The 59% reskilling gap is the central policy challenge. Businesses that solve the reskilling/credential pipeline capture enormous value.

## 7. EDUCATION PIPELINE DISRUPTION

### Enrollment Trends (US, Fall 2025)
- Total enrollment: **19.4 million** (recovered from pandemic but still below 2011 peak of 20.1M)
- Community college enrollment: **+3.0%** (growth driver)
- Private 4-year institutions: **Declining**
- International enrollment: **Down 17%** (fall 2025) -- critical for STEM programs
- The "enrollment cliff" (from declining birth rates post-2007) is now hitting

### STEM Pipeline Under Threat
- Computer science graduate enrollment: **Down 14%**
- International students comprise **>50% of graduate/doctoral completers** in CS and multiple engineering disciplines
- Declining international enrollment + declining domestic enrollment = compound STEM pipeline pressure
- Postgraduate declines in healthcare, law, and STEM programs

### Alternative Credentials Surging
- Certificates: **Up 28%**
- Undergraduate certificates: **+14.7% since 2023**
- **30+ US states** invested a combined **$8.1 billion** in short-term workforce credentials in 2025
- Micro-credentials, digital badges, and non-degree programs accelerating
- Institutions adopting platforms for stackable, modular credentials

### AI Impact on Education Itself
- **63% of US teens** using AI tools (ChatGPT etc.) for schoolwork
- Only **30% of teachers** feel confident using AI tools
- **81% of teachers** say AI saves time on administrative work
- AI tutoring expanding: adaptive learning (43% of educators), automated grading (41%), chatbots (35%), intelligent tutoring systems (29%)
- California State University system partnered with Microsoft, OpenAI, Google
- 2026 expected to be the year many campuses move from **pilot to full-scale AI integration**
- AI tutoring viewed as complement, not substitute for relational teaching

**2031 Implication**: The traditional university model faces simultaneous disruption from enrollment demographics (fewer 18-year-olds), AI tools (students can bypass traditional learning), and alternative credentials (employers accepting non-degree pathways). By 2031, the education sector will have bifurcated: elite institutions retain brand value while mid-tier institutions face existential enrollment pressure. The $8.1B state investment in short-term credentials signals policy recognition that the 4-year degree pipeline is insufficient. AI-native education platforms that deliver verified skills at scale (especially targeting India's 12M annual workforce entrants and Africa's 830M youth) represent massive market opportunity.

## 8. PEREZ CYCLE DATA: INSTALLATION -> DEPLOYMENT TRANSITION

### Current Phase Assessment
According to Perez framework analysis, **we are deep in the Installation Phase of AI**, with early signals of an approaching turning point. This maps to the "Frenzy" sub-phase of Installation.

### Historical Parallels
| Revolution | Installation Phase | Turning Point | Deployment Phase |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Railways (1830s-1840s) | Massive rail buildout | Railway Mania crash (1847) | Network effects, standardization |
| Electricity (1880s-1900s) | Power station buildout | Panic of 1907 | Mass electrification |
| ICT (1970s-2000s) | Internet infrastructure | Dot-com crash (2000-01) | Cloud, mobile, platforms |
| **AI (2020s-?)** | **DC buildout, model training** | **TBD (approaching?)** | **Broad economic deployment** |

### Evidence We Are Still in Installation
1. **Massive infrastructure investment**: $192.7B in AI startup funding through Oct 2025; AI captured ~50% of all global VC funding (up from 34% in 2024)
2. **Widening gap** between technology leaders and the rest of the economy
3. **Regulatory apparatus struggling** to keep pace
4. **Speculative capital dominance**: Financial expectations diverging from real economic returns

### Signals of Approaching Turning Point
1. **AI startup failure rate**: 42% fail from insufficient market demand; 85% expected to be out of business within 3 years; median lifespan ~18 months
2. **MIT study impact**: Claim that 95% of generative AI initiatives fail "rattled markets" in summer 2025
3. **Enterprise AI revenue reality**: $37B in 2025 (3x YoY growth) -- growing fast but tiny relative to infrastructure spend
4. **Application layer catching up**: $19B in user-facing products vs $18B in infrastructure -- application spend now exceeding infrastructure spend

### VC Funding Composition Shift
- AI = ~50% of all global VC funding in 2025 (first time a single category captured majority)
- Enterprise AI revenue: $19B applications vs $18B infrastructure (applications now >50% of generative AI spending)
- This applications-exceeding-infrastructure pattern is a **classic early signal** of Installation-to-Deployment transition in Perez framework

### CapEx Signals
- PE deal value for data center targets **more than doubled** in 2024 (+52%)
- On pace for another strong year in 2025
- No clear deceleration in infrastructure capex yet -- still accelerating
- However, hyperscaler rhetoric is shifting from "build at all costs" to "efficiency and utilization"

**2031 Implication**: The Perez framework suggests we are in late Installation / early Turning Point for AI. If the historical pattern holds, a correction or "crash" (financial or sentiment) occurs before the Deployment phase, which is when the technology creates broad economic value. The 85% AI startup failure rate and application-layer revenue exceeding infrastructure spending are early Turning Point signals. By 2031, we should be entering the early Deployment phase -- when AI shifts from speculative infrastructure build to systematic economic integration. This is the phase where the structural transformations this engine tracks (Baumol cures, cost-structure collapses, Coasean shrinkage) actually manifest at scale. The current Installation phase is building the substrate; the Deployment phase (roughly 2028-2040) is when businesses exploiting these structural forces achieve maximum leverage.

## SYNTHESIS: KEY STRUCTURAL FORCES FOR 2031 ECONOMY MAP

### Force 1: Energy as Gatekeeper
Energy is THE binding constraint on AI deployment pace. By 2031, the winners will be defined by who solved power access (nuclear restarts, SMR deployment, dedicated renewables, BYOP). This creates a new Ricardian rent around power-advantaged locations and a massive buildout opportunity in energy infrastructure.

### Force 2: Demographic Divergence Creates Asymmetric Demand
The world splits into three demographic regimes by 2031:
- **Shrinking labor force** (Japan, China, EU, US-native): Creates massive pull for automation, AI deployment, and care economy solutions
- **Peak dividend** (India, parts of Southeast Asia): Creates massive supply of workers needing AI-era skills
- **Pre-dividend** (Africa): Creates massive future market for AI-native services, but infrastructure-constrained near-term

These three regimes create fundamentally different business opportunities and different economic force profiles.

### Force 3: The Reskilling Chasm
39% of skills obsolete by 2030 + 59% of workers not receiving adequate training = the largest skills mismatch in modern economic history. This is a Baumol cost disease in reverse -- education/training is the sector most needing transformation and least equipped for it. Alternative credentials surging (certificates +28%) signals market recognition.

### Force 4: Perez Turning Point Window
Late Installation / early Turning Point means 2026-2028 is the highest-risk, highest-opportunity window. Startup failure rates are high (85% within 3 years) but the shift from infrastructure to application spending signals that deployment-phase businesses are becoming viable. The optimal entry window for structural-force businesses is NOW through the Turning Point.

### Force 5: Critical Mineral Chokepoints
China's rare earth export controls + copper structural deficit + lithium supply shortfall by 2035 create hardware cost uncertainty. Businesses that are software-heavy or mineral-light have structural cost advantages. Recycling, material substitution, and supply chain diversification are infrastructure-layer opportunities.

### Force 6: Water as Emerging Constraint
Under-regulated, under-priced, and increasingly scarce in data center hotspots. By 2031, expect water to become a regulated input for data centers, creating compliance costs and favoring water-efficient operations. First-mover advantage in water-efficient cooling tech.
