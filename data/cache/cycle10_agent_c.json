(2) BPO layer: $20B+ MASSIVE INCUMBENTS adding AI to human-first model (TTEC, Concentrix, Teleperformance, Alorica, Foundever). (3) AI-first managed service layer: <$500M SPARSE. Sierra AI (~$200M+, enterprise agents), Decagon (~$100M, autonomous agents), Parloa (~$90M, EU voice AI) are tool/agent oriented, NOT managed service providers. No identified company at scale specifically operates as 'AI-first + human escalation managed support service.' The BPO-to-AI approach (human-first with AI augmentation) is structurally different from the AI-first approach (AI handles 65%, humans handle 35% escalation).

The stalling risk identified in Cycle 9 is resolved. The engine's analytical rigor (4 kills, 11 parks, 7 rejects across 22 evaluated opportunities) provides confidence that when a PURSUE is issued, it is well-grounded. Key contributions this cycle: (1) Resolved 3 overdue research questions, (2) First application of IO table propagation methodology, (3) First cross-domain hypothesis testing producing actionable insights, (4) Discovery of 'hidden density' (incumbent AI adoption) as new analytical dimension.",
