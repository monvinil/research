### Staffing Company Stocks (P2 canary)
  RHI (Robert Half (professional staffing)): -50.97%
  MAN (ManpowerGroup): -38.95%
  KELYA (Kelly Services): -20.46%
  Staffing companies declining = employers cutting flexible labor. This leads BLS employment data by 1-3 months. All three declining together = broad-based labor market softening, not sector-specific.

### AI Infrastructure Stocks (P1)
  NVDA (NVIDIA (AI infrastructure)): 4.38%
  MSFT (Microsoft (Azure AI)): -20.73%
  GOOG (Google (AI/Cloud)): 60.89%

### Search Trends: Distress
  Rising distress search interest leads actual economic data by 2-4 weeks. Spikes in "layoff" searches precede BLS job loss data. "bankruptcy" search interest precedes court filing data.

### Search Trends: Ai Adoption
  Rising "automate my job" searches indicate workers sensing displacement. Rising "AI assistant" and business AI searches indicate employer adoption. The gap between the two is the P7 timing arbitrage window.

## International Comparative Data

### World Bank: Business Env
  Analysis: Countries with fastest business formation + lowest tax burden are where AI-native entrants face least friction. Compare with services trade data to find markets where AI businesses can serve US/EU clients from lower-friction jurisdictions.
  - Time to start a business (days)
  - Cost to start a business (% GNI per capita)
  - Total tax & contribution rate (% of profit)

### World Bank: Labor Markets
  Analysis: High GDP per capita + high services employment % = maximum Baumol stored energy. These markets have the most to gain from AI cost structure collapse. Low GDP per capita markets have less stored energy but also less competitive density.
  - Labor force participation rate (%)
    United Arab Emirates: 78.484 (2024)
    Argentina: 61.862 (2024)
    Brazil: 63.339 (2024)
    Germany: 60.921 (2024)
  - Unemployment rate (%)
    United Arab Emirates: 2.16 (2024)
    Argentina: 7.15 (2024)
    Brazil: 6.801 (2024)
    Germany: 3.4 (2024)
  - Employment in services (% of total)
    United Arab Emirates: 67.9435420294033 (2024)
    Argentina: 71.6393298183816 (2024)
    Brazil: 71.9821226349216 (2024)
    Germany: 72.6164237512878 (2024)

### World Bank: Services Trade
  Analysis: Countries with rapidly growing service exports (India, Poland, Philippines) are already capturing cross-border arbitrage. Rising US service imports = growing demand for cheaper delivery. AI augmentation of offshore professionals amplifies this trend.
  - Service exports (current US$)
    United Arab Emirates: 181320626276.378 (2024)
    Argentina: 17166848808.2309 (2024)
    Brazil: 48056008999.85 (2024)
    Germany: 470054785305.203 (2024)
  - Service imports (current US$)
    United Arab Emirates: 116650782845.473 (2024)
    Argentina: 22916771396.1509 (2024)

    Germany: 64.0456505820091 (2024)

### World Bank: Tech Readiness
  Analysis: High R&D spending + high broadband penetration = AI-ready infrastructure. Markets with high tech readiness but low competitive density are prime for leapfrog disruption.
  - R&D expenditure (% of GDP)
  - Fixed broadband per 100 people
  - Internet users (% of population)
    United Arab Emirates: 100 (2024)
    Argentina: 89.6672 (2024)
    Brazil: 84.4635 (2024)
    Germany: 93.5 (2024)

### OECD: Leading
  CLI above 100 = expansion, below 100 = contraction. Turning points in CLI lead GDP by 6-9 months. Countries where CLI is rolling over are entering the window where distressed assets become available.
  Data points: 0

### OECD: Labor
  Cross-country unemployment trends reveal where labor markets are tightest (opportunity for AI substitution) vs loosest (available workforce for hybrid models).
  Data points: 0

### OECD: Tech
  Countries with highest R&D/GDP ratio have the deepest technology infrastructure. Cross-reference with business environment data: high R&D + low friction = fastest AI adoption.
  Data points: 0

### Eurostat: Labor Costs
  EU Labour Cost Index rising in services = Baumol stored energy building in EU. Compare with US ECI to see if pressure is higher/lower in EU. Higher EU labor rigidity means MORE stored energy but SLOWER release.
  Records: 0

### Eurostat: Ai Adoption
  EU AI adoption rate by country shows where the market is most receptive. Higher adoption = more demand for AI services but also more competition. Lower adoption = greenfield but may indicate regulatory or cultural barriers.
  Records: 0

### Eurostat: Biz Demography
  EU firm birth/death rates compared to US Census BDS. Higher death rate in services = liquidation cascade hitting EU. Compare with US rates to see if EU is ahead or behind in the disruption cycle.
  Records: 0

# CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS CYCLES

## Cycle 6 (2026-02-10)
Cycle 6 is the counter-signal revolution — the first cycle where the engine confronted its own conclusions with serious counter-evidence, and the conclusions lost. Healthcare Staffing AI killed by federal legislation. Agentic SMB Back-Office killed by incumbent moat + precedent failure. Distressed Professional Services parked due to competitive saturation. The kill index is populated for the first time. This is the engine reaching maturity.

## Cycle 7 (2026-02-09)
Cycle 7 is the competitive density reckoning. Seven candidate sectors were scanned for competitive landscape: veterinary ($200-400M, sparse), translation ($2-4B+, crowded), property management ($1-2B+, moderate), insurance ($3-5B+, moderate-crowded), freight ($5-8B+, crowded), construction ($3-5B+, crowded), and surveying ($500M-1B, sparse-moderate with duopoly). Five of seven were killed or parked. Construction AI Coordinator — previously our #1 opportunity at score 65 — was parked after discovering $3-5B+ VC/PE deployed including Procore ($10B+ market cap). Only veterinary services passed the density filter. Simultaneously, LATAM research invalidated the professional services cascade hypothesis (Argentina's distress is macro-driven, Brazil is growing) and reframed the opportunity as nearshoring arbitrage. P7 Timing Arbitrage research produced the first named failure cases (Klarna, CNET, SI, Air Canada, NEDA), identifying customer support as the top vacuum sector and DOGE federal reductions as the largest timing arbitrage event. New emergent insight: competitive density appears to be a UNIVERSAL property of sectors flagged by the Principles Engine — if the disruption is obvious enough for our framework to identify, it's obvious enough for billions in VC/PE to have already arrived. The search must focus on sectors where the disruption thesis requires domain-specific insight that generic pattern recognition misses.

## Cycle 8 (2026-02-09)
Cycle 8 marks a phase transition in the engine's analytical power. For the first time, we have MARKET-PRICED confirmation of the professional labor substitution thesis: Robert Half -51%, ManpowerGroup -39%, Kelly Services -20% over one year. Equity markets are telling us what government statistics (BLS, JOLTS) haven't confirmed yet — professional labor demand is structurally declining, not cyclically. Simultaneously, the engine's first composite indices both hit 100.0 (maximum): P3 Cost Collapse (productivity surging, unit labor costs declining) and Capital Environment (rates falling, credit easing, stress low). The Beveridge Curve correlation at r=-0.658 confirms structural mismatch — this is not a normal recession pattern. The convergence of these three signals — market confirmation of labor substitution, AI costs at minimum, and capital at maximum availability — creates the most favorable macro environment the engine has ever measured for AI-native business formation. Customer Support Vacuum surges from #2 (score 58) to co-#1 (score 65), tied with Veterinary Services. LATAM Nearshoring rises from 55 to 60. Top score rises for the first time since Cycle 3 (62->65) on external macro validation, not thesis weakening. Staffing industry itself was assessed as opportunity and REJECTED — the value is as signal, not entry point. First international data collected but not yet deeply analyzed.

# KILL INDEX — Do NOT produce signals matching these patterns

- [K-001] Nurse ratio manipulation is illegal. Federal bills H.R. 3415 and S. 1709 explicitly prohibit counting technology as a substitute for nurse staffing in ratio calculations. California SB 596 increases penalties for ratio violations. The core value proposition — shifting nurse-patient ratios from 1:4 to 1:12 through AI monitoring — is not merely difficult, it is prohibited by law. Additionally, NNU (largest US nurses' union) is running a funded national anti-AI campaign across 12 states, creating organized political opposition to any technology-as-substitute framing.
  Affects: demographic_gap in ['healthcare', 'hospital_staffing', 'nurse_staffing', 'clinical_AI', 'healthcare_workforce_management']
- [K-002] Incumbent moat (Intuit/QuickBooks 80%+ market share with $100M OpenAI partnership) plus proven startup failure pattern. Bench.co raised $113M, built exactly this product, reached 35K customers, then catastrophically failed Dec 2024 — unit economics never worked at SMB price points. Pilot raised $325M from Sequoia/Bezos and achieved only 0.4% market penetration. The market has been tested at $113M and $325M by elite teams and has been proven non-viable as a standalone product. Additionally, 70% of SMBs still use paper-based bookkeeping after 43 years of digital alternatives — the adoption barrier is behavioral, not economic.
  Affects: cost_structure_collapse in ['smb_bookkeeping', 'smb_back_office', 'smb_accounting', 'fractional_cfo', 'outsourced_finance']
- [K-003] Extreme competitive density. Total VC/PE deployed exceeds $2-4B+. DeepL (~$100M+ raised, ~$2B valuation), Unbabel ($91M), Lilt ($92.5M), Phrase/Memsource ($150M+ PE-backed), Smartling ($60M), Lokalise ($50M+), Language I/O ($12M), and many others. Plus horizontal AI competitors (Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, Meta NLLB, ChatGPT) competing at free or near-free tier. The translation market is simultaneously crowded by specialized startups AND commoditized by Big Tech free offerings. No viable entry point at $500K-$1M.
  Affects: cost_structure_collapse in ['translation', 'localization', 'language_services', 'interpretation']
- [K-004] Extreme competitive density plus the most expensive precedent failure in our scanning universe. Convoy raised $900M and shut down in October 2023, with assets acquired by Flexport. Total VC/PE deployed in digital freight exceeds $5-8B+: Transfix ($275M), Loadsmart ($200M+), Emerge ($220M), project44 ($500M+), FourKites ($250M), and others. C.H. Robinson ($24B gross revenue) is investing heavily in Navisphere AI from dominant incumbent position. The digital brokerage model has been tested at massive capital levels and has NOT displaced traditional brokers.
  Affects: cost_structure_collapse in ['freight_brokerage', 'logistics', 'trucking', 'supply_chain']
