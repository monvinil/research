Tracing how professional labor disruption (staffing canary -51%) propagates through service delivery chain: (1) CUSTOMER SUPPORT: First to be disrupted (most routine, most volume). CURRENT CYCLE. (2) SALES OPERATIONS: Sales development reps (SDRs) are next — AI handles prospecting, qualification, scheduling. ~6-12 months behind customer support on S-curve. (3) ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT: Ongoing client relationship management. AI handles data analysis, reporting, health scoring. Humans handle strategic relationships. ~12-18 months behind. (4) CLIENT SUCCESS: Proactive retention and expansion. Hybrid model similar to customer support but higher-touch. ~12-24 months behind. (5) REVENUE OPERATIONS: Data integration, reporting, forecasting. Most automatable, but currently handled by small internal teams not outsourced services. STRATEGIC IMPLICATION: If we build AI-first hybrid managed customer support NOW, we can EXPAND into adjacent functions (sales ops, account management, client success) as the disruption propagates. This creates a 'land and expand' strategy where each customer support client becomes a candidate for broader AI-first service delivery. The TAM expands from customer support alone ($10-15B) to customer-facing operations ($40-60B).",
