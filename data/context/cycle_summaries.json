Five of seven were killed or parked. Construction AI Coordinator — previously our #1 opportunity at score 65 — was parked after discovering $3-5B+ VC/PE deployed including Procore ($10B+ market cap). Only veterinary services passed the density filter. Simultaneously, LATAM research invalidated the professional services cascade hypothesis (Argentina's distress is macro-driven, Brazil is growing) and reframed the opportunity as nearshoring arbitrage. P7 Timing Arbitrage research produced the first named failure cases (Klarna, CNET, SI, Air Canada, NEDA), identifying customer support as the top vacuum sector and DOGE federal reductions as the largest timing arbitrage event. New emergent insight: competitive density appears to be a UNIVERSAL property of sectors flagged by the Principles Engine — if the disruption is obvious enough for our framework to identify, it's obvious enough for billions in VC/PE to have already arrived. The search must focus on sectors where the disruption thesis requires domain-specific insight that generic pattern recognition misses.",

Simultaneously, the engine's first composite indices both hit 100.0 (maximum): P3 Cost Collapse (productivity surging, unit labor costs declining) and Capital Environment (rates falling, credit easing, stress low). The Beveridge Curve correlation at r=-0.658 confirms structural mismatch — this is not a normal recession pattern.
