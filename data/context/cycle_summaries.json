  "notes": "v2 engine. Previous 11 cycles ran v1 (prosecutorial filtering). v2 uses construct-first landscape mapping. Cycle numbering restarts at 1. Cycle 2 expanded scope to include physical production/manufacturing/robotics. Cycle 3 was the first CORRECTION cycle: real data replaces estimates, counter-signals treated equally, scores moved both up and down. Cycle 4 is the QUANTITATIVE DEEPENING cycle: O*NET + BLS data replaces qualitative automation estimates with government data, stress tests on top 3 with real competitive intelligence, 3 under-explored sectors assessed with verdicts. Cycle 5 is the BUSINESS MODEL DECOMPOSITION cycle: 11 sectors decomposed into 102 specific models at YC-application granularity, each scored independently with web-searched competitor data. Cycle 6 is the ARCHITECTURE-BASED DECOMPOSITION cycle: 8 structural forces x 10 business architectures = 187 models. New 5-axis structural durability scoring replaces tactical accessibility scoring. KEY FINDING: physical architectures (acquire-and-modernize, rollup) dominate at 84 avg; vertical SaaS scores LOWEST at 67 avg. Cycle 7 is the NAICS-SYSTEMATIC EXPANSION + STRESS TEST cycle: 187 -> 387 models via NAICS QCEW screening of 293 4-digit industries, stress-tested scoring with 3 weight vectors (7/10 robust), mapped 80-cell force x architecture matrix (16 impossible, 12 unexplored filled). KEY FINDINGS: physical > digital is partially weight-dependent (physical more durable, digital data compounding more force), NAICS bottom-up screening discovers 8 new high-value sectors, PE distress extends to veterinary/dental/staffing/printing. Cycle 8 is the MULTI-SOURCE CROSS-REFERENCING cycle: 7 data source types, 70+ connector methods activated, top 20 cross-referenced against 3-7 independent sources. KEY FINDINGS: financial cascade CONFIRMED (7 sources), staffing destruction STRONGEST signal (RHI -53%, MAN -44%), physical production confirmed by ETF flows, zero-density validated, auto repair competitive. v3-2 is the ECONOMY MAP UPDATE cycle: 84 signals scanned, 30 graded, 5 sector briefs, 15 model cards rated (5-axis), 4 geographic reports (US/China/EU/India), 5 new patterns (P-028 through P-032). KEY: Financial Services UPGRADED to acceleration (first v3 phase transition). F5/F6 fully characterized. 7/15 models are STRUCTURAL_WINNERS. Fear economy validated ($86B by 2030). v3-3 is the MODEL MIGRATION + MACRO EXPANSION cycle: 522 v2 models migrated through 5-axis rating + 45 new macro-derived models. 295 individually rated + 287 algorithmically estimated = 582 total. PIVOT: Models restored as central output, economy map demoted to grading context. KEY: 27 STRUCTURAL_WINNERS at 9% rate validates calibration. F1+F2 combination is the scoring differentiator. Physical architectures still dominate."
