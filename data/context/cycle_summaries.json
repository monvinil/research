Sectors exposed to AI cost disruption (professional services -0.4%, transportation -0.9%) are entering the liquidation cascade while labor-absorbing sectors (healthcare +2.6%) face permanent shortages amplified by immigration policy. The critical insight is that these are not separate stories — they are two sides of the same structural shift, and the opportunity corridor sits at their intersection. Bond markets (HY spread 2.87%) have not priced this divergence, meaning the distress window is open but not yet crowded. The 1000x inference cost reduction confirms P1 infrastructure overhang, making H1 entry timing optimal for agentic-first businesses that consume cheap compute rather than build it.",
