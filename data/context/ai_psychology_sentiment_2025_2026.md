## Compiled February 2026 | For 2031 Economy Mapping

---

## 1. AI FEAR / ANXIETY DATA

### Pew Research Center Surveys (2025)

**Headline:** 50% of Americans say they are more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in daily life, up from 37% in 2021. Concern is the dominant sentiment and growing.

**Key Data Points:**
- **64%** of Americans think AI will lead to fewer jobs in the next two decades (April 2025, n=5,400+)
- **56%** of U.S. adults are "extremely or very concerned" about AI eliminating jobs
- **52%** of workers specifically worry about being personally replaced
- Only **25%** of AI experts share the same level of concern about job elimination (vs. 56% of the public) -- a massive expert-public divergence
- **21%** of U.S. workers now use AI on the job, up from prior year (October 2025)
- Among those using AI at work, attitudes are more positive -- exposure reduces fear

**Demographic Breakdowns:**
- **Age:** Adults 50+ are more concerned than 18-34 year olds, though the U.S. age gap is smaller than in other countries
- **Gender:** Men are more excited than women about AI. 31% of men foresee personal benefit vs. 18% of women
- **Education:** In ~50% of countries surveyed, people with less education are more concerned. AI use is concentrated among workers with bachelor's degrees or higher
- **Income:** Higher-income workers are more likely to use AI and view it positively; lower-income workers express more generalized anxiety but less specific personal threat perception

**Global Context (Pew, October 2025):** Concern varies dramatically by country. Americans lead Western nations in AI anxiety.

### Edelman Trust Barometer (2025)

**Headline:** AI trust is at an inflection point. Only 32% of Americans trust AI -- the lowest among major economies surveyed.

**Key Data Points:**
- **Trust in AI by country:** China 87%, Brazil 67%, Germany 39%, UK 36%, **U.S. 32%**
- In the U.S., daily AI use is still in the single digits
- **Experience is the key trust driver:** People who use AI regularly trust it more. Hands-on experience is the fastest route to trust
- Emotional hesitation, lack of daily habit formation, and job security uncertainty are the primary adoption barriers
- Companies deploying AI are expected to explain how AI affects jobs and invest in retraining

**Implication for 2031:** The U.S. has the largest trust deficit among major economies. This creates a drag on adoption speed but also creates outsized demand for trust-building services, verification, and human-in-the-loop products.

### Gallup Workforce Data (2025)

**Headline:** AI workplace use jumped to 45% (at least a few times/year), but half of workers still say it's "not at all likely" AI eliminates their job within five years.

**Key Data Points:**
- **45%** of employees used AI at work at least a few times/year (Q3 2025), up from 40% (Q2 2025)
- Frequent use (few times/week+): grew from **19% to 23%**
- Daily use: **8% to 10%**
- Only **37%** of employees say their employer has implemented AI to improve productivity
- **40%** say their organization has not adopted AI at all
- Nearly **25%** don't know their employer's AI status
- Managerial support is the strongest predictor of employee AI adoption

### Mercer Global Talent Trends (2026 Preview)

**Headline:** Employee concerns about AI job loss have surged from 28% (2024) to 40% (2026).

**Key Data Points:**

## 2. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE

### University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index

**Current Reading:** 57.3 (February 2026 preliminary)

**Trend:**
- Feb 2026: 57.3 (third consecutive monthly increase)
- Jan 2026: 56.4
- Dec 2025: 52.9
- Still roughly **20% below** January 2025 levels

**Notable Dynamics:**
- Gains driven by consumers with significant stock holdings
- Sentiment among households without equity exposure has stagnated at depressed levels
- Year-ahead inflation expectations fell to 3.5% from 4.0%
- A split-screen economy: asset holders feeling better, wage-dependent households not

- [Advisor Perspectives: Consumer Sentiment Down Nearly 30% from a Year Ago](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/12/19/consumer-sentiment-down-nearly-30-from-a-year-ago)

### Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index

**Current Reading:** 84.5 (January 2026) -- a 12-year low

**Trend:**
- January 2026: 84.5 (down 9.7 points from December)
- Present Situation Index: 113.7 (down 9.9 points)
- **Expectations Index: 65.1** -- well below the 80 threshold that usually signals recession

**Assessment:** Consumer confidence has collapsed. The Expectations Index at 65.1 is a significant recession indicator. Confidence fell for a fifth straight month in December before an even sharper January drop.

- [Axios: Consumer Confidence Plunges to 12-Year Low](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/27/consumer-confidence-conference-board-gdp)

### Composite Consumer Sentiment Assessment

**Direction of travel: DOWN.** Both major indices show deteriorating consumer confidence, with the Conference Board Expectations Index flashing recession warning levels. The bifurcation between asset-rich and asset-poor consumers suggests AI-driven economic transformation is amplifying existing inequality in sentiment.

---

## 3. CEO / EXECUTIVE CONFIDENCE

### Conference Board CEO Confidence (Q4 2025)

- CEO Confidence: **48** (down 1 from 49 in Q3) -- below the 50 neutral threshold
- **52%** of CEOs cite cost reduction/operational efficiency as primary AI investment driver
- **25%** cite new products and services
- **43%** say top AI concern is losing competitive advantage to early adopters
- CEOs expect AI to fundamentally transform **>50% of job roles** in their org within 5 years
- **25%** expect this transformation within 2 years

Source: [Conference Board: US CEO Confidence](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/CEO-Confidence/)

### PwC 29th Global CEO Survey (January 2026, n=4,454)

**Headline:** CEO confidence in revenue outlook hits five-year low. AI is creating a defining divide between leaders and laggards.

**The AI ROI Gap:**
- Only **12%** of CEOs say AI has delivered BOTH cost and revenue benefits
- **33%** report gains in either cost OR revenue (not both)
- **56%** say they have seen NO significant financial benefit from AI to date
- **42%** of CEOs say their top concern is whether they are transforming fast enough

**The Divide:**
- CEOs reporting both cost and revenue gains are **2-3x more likely** to have embedded AI extensively across products, demand generation, and strategic decision-making
- Companies that reinvent well achieve a **71% performance premium** (profit margin + revenue growth combined)

### World Economic Forum / Vistage / EY Findings

- **68%** of CEOs are increasing AI investment in 2026
- ~$500 billion expected to be spent on AI in 2026
- **43%** of respondents name AI/technology as top investment priority for 2026, outpacing all other priorities
- **41%** of executives say ROI measurement is their top AI priority for 2026

- [Conference Board: AI and the C-Suite 2026](https://www.conference-board.org/research/ced-policy-backgrounders/ai-and-the-c-suite-implications-for-ceo-strategy-in-2026)

### Composite CEO Assessment

**The paradox:** CEOs are pouring money into AI (68% increasing spend, $500B total expected) while 56% report zero financial benefit so far. This is fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) driven investment, not ROI-driven investment. The 12% who have cracked both cost AND revenue benefits are pulling dramatically ahead, creating a winner-take-most dynamic. By 2031, this divide will have resolved into clear winners and a large pool of companies that spent heavily on AI with little to show for it.

## 4. SECTOR-SPECIFIC ADOPTION RESISTANCE

### Healthcare: Trust Gap as Primary Barrier

**Resistance Level: HIGH**

- Adoption is outpacing trust -- a structural problem
- Patients who prefer personal interaction, feel dependent on AI, or are skeptical of AI's promises are more likely to resist
- Structural opacity (can't see how AI risk scores are generated) creates foundational trust gap with direct clinical consequences
- Key barriers: algorithmic bias, lack of transparency, privacy risks, unclear accountability
- Invasiveness matters: resistance scales with how physically, socially, and psychologically invasive AI is perceived
- **2026 shift:** Large health plans moving from "no AI" policies to embracing AI/ML for efficiency, driven by regulatory certainty
- Trust in process (how AI is used), not technology itself, is key to adoption

### Legal: Liability + Business Model Conflict

**Resistance Level: HIGH (but accelerating)**

- **78%** of U.S. law firms were not using any AI tools at all as of year-end 2024
- **31%** of legal professionals personally used generative AI at work in 2025 (up from 27%)
- **700+ court cases** worldwide now involve AI hallucinations, with sanctions up to five-figure monetary penalties
- Higher productivity reduces billable hours -- AI threatens the dominant revenue model
- Firms will only adopt when a product "reduces measurable time or risk without creating new liability"
- 2026 outlook: Mindset shifting from existential threat to business development differentiator
- Growing patchwork of client AI guidelines, audits, and compliance demands forcing governance frameworks

### Education: Academic Integrity Crisis + Cultural Tradition

**Resistance Level: MODERATE-HIGH (fragmenting)**

- Teachers showing "conscious resistance" -- pedagogical trust in AI is low despite technical comfort
- Trust does NOT correlate with technical training; it correlates with perception of concrete institutional support
- **75%** of faculty have encountered GenAI plagiarism
- **88%** of students report using GenAI tools for assessments (UK Higher Education Policy Institute, Feb 2025)
- Universities splitting: some embracing (CSU partnerships), some restricting/banning
- Paradigm shift underway: moving from detection/punishment toward cultivating culture of honesty
- Concerns about dehumanization and "a demand for a principle of subsidiarity"

- [Harvard: Academic Integrity and Teaching With(out) AI](https://oaisc.fas.harvard.edu/academic-integrity-and-teaching-without-ai/)

### Financial Services: Regulation-Driven Caution

**Resistance Level: MODERATE (governance gap)**

- **70%+** of banks report using agentic AI in some form, but governance frameworks are "disturbingly lacking" (EY 2026)
- Fear of enforcement actions significantly delays adoption, even where AI would help
- Months-long model risk reviews and compliance processes required before deploying any new AI, even low-risk use cases
- 2025 shift: early LLM enthusiasm gave way to caution over explainability, bias, data exposure
- Human-in-the-loop oversight became a regulatory expectation
- Smaller, specialized language models emerging as preferred alternative for compliance
- US consumers wary of fully automated financial decisions, citing accuracy and privacy fears
- No sweeping AI-specific federal rules expected; existing frameworks (SEC, FINRA) being applied to AI

### Sector Resistance Summary Table

| Sector | Resistance Level | Primary Driver | 2031 Projection |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Healthcare | High | Patient trust + opacity + liability | Bifurcated: admin/back-office AI normalized, clinical AI still contested |
| Legal | High (declining) | Business model conflict + liability | AI-augmented practice standard, but human judgment premium remains |
| Education | Moderate-High | Academic integrity + cultural values | AI tools ubiquitous, human teaching premium emerges |
| Financial Services | Moderate | Regulatory caution + governance gaps | Heavily AI-automated back-office, human-in-loop for client-facing |

## 6. WORKER DISPLACEMENT SIGNALS

### Actual Layoff Data

- **55,000** job cuts directly attributed to AI in 2025 (Challenger, Gray & Christmas) -- 4.5% of 1.17M total layoffs

### Trust Premium Assessment

The "Human Premium" is real and measurable. It manifests as:
1. **Direct willingness-to-pay** for verified human creation (art, music, content)
2. **Loyalty premium** for human customer service (retention value)
3. **Brand differentiation** for companies offering human-in-the-loop services
4. **Emerging verification infrastructure** (blockchain stamps, biometric proofs)

**2031 Projection:** This becomes a meaningful market segment -- not replacing AI, but creating a parallel "artisan" economy where human provenance commands premium pricing, similar to how organic/farm-to-table created parallel food markets.

## SYNTHESIS: IMPLICATIONS FOR 2031 ECONOMY MAP

### Five Key Structural Dynamics

**1. The Trust-Adoption Gap Creates a Multi-Year Drag (and Opportunity)**
Only 32% of Americans trust AI. 56% of CEOs see no financial benefit yet. But 68% are increasing spend anyway. This gap between investment and trust will take years to close, creating sustained demand for trust-bridging services, human-in-the-loop products, and verification infrastructure through 2031.

**2. Fear Is a Market, Not Just a Sentiment**
Fear-driven markets (safety, compliance, governance, ethics, insurance, verification) total ~$40B today and are growing at 20-45% CAGR. By 2031, these could exceed $300-500B. Fear of AI is itself a massive economic force creating entirely new industry categories.

**3. The Bifurcation Is Accelerating**
- Consumer sentiment: asset holders vs. wage earners
- CEO results: 12% AI winners vs. 56% seeing zero benefit
- Workers: 45% using AI at work vs. 40% whose employers haven't adopted
- Sectors: finance/tech adopting fast, healthcare/legal/education resisting

This bifurcation will produce clear winners and losers by 2031. The middle ground is collapsing.

**4. Anticipatory Disruption Is Larger Than Actual Disruption**
Only 2% of executives report making large layoffs from actual AI implementation. The vast majority of AI layoffs are anticipatory -- based on what AI *might* do. This creates a psychological overshoot: more fear, more displacement, and more demand for safety/retraining services than the actual technology warranted. By 2031, we'll likely see a correction where actual AI capabilities meet reality.

**5. The Human Premium Is a Durable Market Segment**
96% of music professionals open to paying more for human-made. 86% of consumers want human interaction in brand experience. This isn't going away -- it will formalize into verification systems, certification standards, and premium pricing tiers that persist through 2031 and beyond.

### Sentiment Trajectory (2025 -> 2031 Projection)

| Metric | 2025-26 Baseline | Direction | 2031 Estimate |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| % Americans concerned about AI | 50% | Up then plateau | 55-60% (normalized anxiety) |
| Consumer confidence | Near 12-yr low | Recovery likely | Moderate (85-100 range) |
| CEO AI investment | $500B/yr, 68% increasing | Sustained but ROI-gated | $1T+/yr, ROI-proven spend |
| Trust in AI (US) | 32% | Slowly rising with exposure | 45-55% |
| Fear-driven market size | ~$40B | Rapid growth | $300-500B |
| Human premium market | Nascent | Formalizing | $50-100B (certification + premium services) |
| Workers fearing displacement | 40% | Peaks 2027-28, then adapts | 25-30% (adaptation + retraining effects) |
