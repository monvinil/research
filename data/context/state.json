Unit economics modeling (revenue per vet, cost per vet with AI augmentation, margin improvement projection).",
    "PRIORITY 3: AI-augmented nearshoring competitive scan. Who is specifically doing 'LATAM professionals + AI tools serving US professional services clients'? Not traditional BPO, not AI-only, not generic nearshoring. What professional services vertical (accounting? legal research? customer success?) shows highest arbitrage and sparsest competition?",
    "PRIORITY 4: Deeper international data analysis. Process the UAE, Germany, and World Bank 16-country datasets collected in Cycle 8. Use for: (a) confirming US-specificity of structural labor shift, (b) identifying countries where Baumol stored energy is highest (largest gap between human labor cost and AI capability), (c) benchmarking staffing canary against international staffing firms (Adecco, Randstad).",
    "PRIORITY 5: Staffing canary propagation tracking. Monitor RHI, MAN, KELYA quarterly. Compare to BLS/JOLTS releases. Track whether the 6-12 month leading indicator hypothesis validates. Also monitor international staffing firms (Adecco, Randstad) for global vs. US-specific signal.",
    "PRIORITY 6: P3 maximum density feedback analysis. With P3 and capital environment both at 100.0, is competitive density increasing across sectors we've already scanned? Re-scan veterinary services density to ensure it hasn't degraded since Cycle 7.",
    "MONITOR: PE roll-up health — Crete, Ascend, Accrual. Check earnings, debt covenants, client retention. Staffing canary may be early warning.",
    "MONITOR: DOGE federal workforce — track service delivery degradation. If measurable, federal services vacuum becomes more actionable.",
    "PROCESS: Add market_price_confirmation (1.1 weight) to grading framework — implemented in Cycle 8.",
    "PROCESS: Consider adding equity market screening as a FIRST-PASS filter before even scanning sectors. If a sector's staffing/service companies are collapsing in equity markets, the disruption is real and priced — then check density."
