Physician adoption moves from invisible (personal ChatGPT use) to institutional (EHR-embedded). AI coding in medical billing reaches 40-50% automation rate (from ~20% today). Hospital-at-home scales to 800+ hospitals as reimbursement clarity solidifies. Pharmacy automation and robotic dispensing become standard in hospital pharmacies serving 200+ beds. Digital pathology AI reaches 15-20% of reference lab volume. Remote patient monitoring crosses 40% adoption for chronic disease. Dental AI (imaging analysis) adopted by 30% of practices. First wave of nursing care monitoring AI (fall detection, medication adherence) deploys at scale in SNFs. Healthcare employment share may moderate slightly (55-60%) as other sectors stabilize.",
    "2028": "Barbell formation accelerates. Premium tier (AI-augmented physicians, surgical robotics, specialty diagnostics) pulls away in compensation and productivity. Commodity tier (home health aides, nursing assistants, social workers) remains labor-intensive and low-wage. The hollowed middle (medical coders, transcriptionists, prior authorization staff, basic radiology reads) begins measurable contraction. Hospital-at-home treats 500K+ patients annually. AI pathology becomes standard of care for cancer screening. Medical coding AI reaches 70%+ automation, triggering workforce restructuring in RCM departments. Site-neutral payment policy fully phases in, accelerating outpatient migration. PE distress peaks and begins workout phase.",

Surgical robotics expands to 40%+ of eligible procedures (from ~15% today). Senior care technology ecosystem matures: integrated monitoring, predictive health alerts, and caregiver coordination platforms. Pharmacy automation handles 80%+ of routine dispensing. The nursing shortage begins structural moderation as: (1) AI monitoring extends each nurse's patient capacity, (2) scope-of-practice laws expand for NPs/PAs, (3) international recruitment programs scale.

The barbell is fully formed. Digital pathology standard across oncology. Remote patient monitoring reduces hospital admissions by 15-20% for managed chronic disease populations. AI prior authorization near-fully automated (CMS-0057-F mandate fully enforced). Humanoid robotics begins pilot deployment in nursing facilities for mobility assistance and logistics.",

The sector employs 24-25M workers (from 21.3M in 2023). Premium tier compensation grows 4-6% annually while commodity tier stagnates at 2-3%. The key structural question is whether AI productivity gains flow to: (A) healthcare cost reduction (benefiting patients and payers), (B) provider margin improvement (benefiting PE owners and health systems), or (C) worker compensation (benefiting nurses and clinicians). Historical pattern (Baumol) suggests costs rise even with technology -- but AI's impact on healthcare may finally break the Baumol trap in administrative functions while reinforcing it in direct care."

The demand is real and non-discretionary, so calling it a 'bubble' is incorrect.

RECLASSIFICATION: P-039 should be reframed as 'structurally sustainable monoculture with concentration risk' -- not fragile like a bubble, but risky like a single-crop economy. The counter-signal (CS07) is correct that demand is real; the original thesis is correct that concentration is dangerous. Both are true simultaneously.",
