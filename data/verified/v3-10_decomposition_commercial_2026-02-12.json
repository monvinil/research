However, this is a GENERIC services business model — system integration exists in every industrial automation vertical (manufacturing, food processing, pharma, etc.). The warehouse-specific system integration market is simply a geographic/vertical slice of a well-established services industry. Adding this as a sub-model would not reveal a granularity insight — it would just confirm that services businesses are less fortified than hardware/platform businesses, which is a universal finding. Large integrators (Dematic $3.24B) dominate major projects; mid-market retrofit is fragmented and ACCESSIBLE. But this is the same competitive structure as system integration in ANY industry."

Revenue independence fails specifically for the WAREHOUSE APPLICATION of humanoids: no humanoid company generates material warehouse-specific revenue yet (Agility/Digit has first commercial revenue at Spanx warehouse but it is a pilot, not scaled). The humanoid robotics market is better modeled as its own sector-level model (which it already is in the engine's inventory as a technology platform play), not as a sub-layer of warehouse fulfillment. When humanoid warehouse deployment reaches scale (projected 2028-2030), it may warrant reassessment. Current finding: humanoid robotics is a CROSS-SECTOR technology platform, not a warehouse-specific value chain layer. Including it here would misrepresent its scope."

Four sub-models pass IVB with opportunity categories of ACCESSIBLE (1), CONTESTED (2), and one excluded as generic services. The parent CLA is accurate for the hardware-dominated full-stack view (Amazon Robotics + Symbotic dominate end-to-end) but systematically suppresses the software and services layers. Layer 6 (Fleet Management SaaS) is the highest-accessibility decomposition product: T-composite 82.0 with ACCESSIBLE opportunity (OPP=67.5). This is a pure SaaS 'picks and shovels' play that was completely invisible at the parent granularity. Layer 2 (Pick & Place) is the highest-transformation-certainty sub-model (81.5) with a unique 3-5 year window before humanoid robotics potentially subsumes the function."

Category 1 is the more immediately actionable finding for new entrants. Category 2 requires more capital but addresses larger markets."
