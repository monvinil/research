These are deeply integrated enterprise systems with 10-20 year switching cycles. Higher ed IT is extremely conservative. AI layer on top of existing systems is the most viable entry but Ellucian and Workday already integrating AI. Lowering MO from 8 to 4 (Ellucian + Workday + Oracle dominate, ultra-long sales cycles), MA from 8 to 4 (decades of student data lock-in + integration depth = very strong moats), VD stays at 5 (admissions, registration, finance, HR, analytics — moderate layers), DV stays at 6 (enrollment cliff creates urgency + AI adds value but incumbents are the primary beneficiaries)."

AI-driven elderly care market growing from $1.4B to $3.1B by 2033. Senior care technology includes: motion sensors detecting behavioral changes, fall detection with 95%+ accuracy, medication adherence monitoring, sleep pattern analysis, wandering prevention for dementia patients. The value proposition: each monitoring platform extends a single caregiver's capacity from 8-10 residents to 15-20 residents for monitoring tasks while maintaining safety. With 250K RN shortage by 2030, technology that multiplies caregiver capacity is structurally necessary.",
