      "headline": "Manufacturing (NAICS 31-33) is the US economy's most UNDERVALUED transformation target: 12.87M workers across 392K establishments generating $1.06T in annual wages, yet it has the highest average opportunity score (68.9) of any sector with 20+ models and has never received a deep dive. The sector sits at the convergence of FOUR structural forces: (1) Silver Tsunami -- owner age 57 average in machine shops, 52.3% of employer businesses owned by 55+, 58% no succession plan; (2) Cobot revolution -- $25-60K per unit, 6-18mo ROI, 42% of SME manufacturers now integrating cobots; (3) Reshoring/nearshoring -- 240K jobs reshored in 2025, $630B+ invested in 140 projects since 2020 (CHIPS Act + tariffs); (4) AI quality control -- 45% of manufacturers cite QC as #1 AI use case, defect detection accuracy 95-100%. Unlike information or financial services sectors where AI disrupts HIGH-wage cognitive work (Baumol cure), manufacturing's transformation is ADDITIVE -- AI and cobots augment a workforce that cannot be replaced because it does not exist (499K trades shortage, machinist median age 57).
