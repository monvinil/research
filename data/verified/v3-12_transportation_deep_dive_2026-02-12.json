The opportunity: build a Shopify-for-freight -- self-serve, cloud-native, AI-powered TMS that a mid-market shipper can deploy in weeks, not months.

But PSYCHOLOGICAL readiness is low: 3.58M truck drivers (plus Teamsters union) represent concentrated political opposition, public trust in autonomous vehicles is <40%, and the cultural identity of trucking as 'last bastion of independent work' creates emotional resistance that transcends economics. The fear friction manifests as: (1) regulatory delay -- legislators in trucking-dependent states will slow autonomous deployment; (2) insurance uncertainty -- who is liable when an autonomous truck is involved in a fatality?; (3) labor action -- Teamsters have signaled willingness to strike over autonomous deployment; (4) shipper hesitation -- many shippers will not use autonomous trucks until forced by cost pressure. The friction is highest in LONG-HAUL TRUCKING (driver displacement is most direct) and lowest in WAREHOUSING (robots augment workers who cannot be hired, not replace existing workers).
