Pharma companies investing in aging (Altos Labs $3B, Calico/Alphabet, Unity Biotechnology, BioAge Labs) need validated aging biomarkers for trial design and regulatory submissions. The FDA's TAME trial (Targeting Aging with Metformin) is establishing the precedent for aging-as-indication. TruDiagnostic (raised $15M) offers consumer epigenetic testing at $350/test, with 50,000+ samples generating a proprietary aging database. Elysium Health sells consumer aging tests.
