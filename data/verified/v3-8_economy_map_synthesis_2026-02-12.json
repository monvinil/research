      "Retail Trade (15.5M workers) enters early disruption with 3 models scoring above 81.0 — retail media networks, warehouse robotics, and autonomous checkout represent the new #1, #2, and #10 overall. AI meets the average American worker",
      "Counter-signals provide first discipline check: FS cascade may be 4-6 year slow burn not 2-3 year acute stress (banks passed $550B stress test, office absorption positive). IT Services 26.8% decline may confuse compositional shift with absolute decline",
