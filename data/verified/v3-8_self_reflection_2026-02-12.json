  "headline_finding": "The engine spent 8 cycles optimizing for transformation certainty while being blind to market accessibility. 28 of the top 50 transformation models are bottom-half in opportunity. Correlation between the two rankings is 0.088 — nearly orthogonal. The engine was systematically recommending fortress markets.",

    {
      "blind_spot": "Fortress market bias",
      "evidence": "Transformation Rank #1 (Retail Media, 86.5) is Opportunity Rank #413 (dead last). Amazon 77% share. Rank #2 (Warehouse Robotics) is O#406. The 5-axis system rewarded certainty without asking 'certainty for whom?'",
      "impact": "The engine's top recommendations were structurally inaccessible. A user following the transformation ranking would target markets where incumbents have locked them out.",
      "fix_applied": "CLA dual ranking. Transformation rank preserved (economy mapping) but Opportunity rank now sits alongside it."

      "blind_spot": "Defense procurement invisibility",
      "evidence": "18 defense models average 75.9 transformation, 48.2 opportunity — a 27.7-point gap, the largest of any sector. Security clearances, ITAR, procurement barriers, classified environments are structurally invisible to the 5-axis system.",
      "impact": "Defense models scored artificially high because SN (structural necessity) doesn't distinguish 'will exist' from 'can be entered'. Palantir's dominance (V3-DEF-002, T#9 → O#412) was completely undetected.",

Yet the engine spent its deep dives on IT Services, Securities, Healthcare — tech-heavy sectors that score well on transformation but middling-to-poor on opportunity.",
      "impact": "The most accessible, actionable opportunities in the economy — buying retiring businesses and upgrading with AI/cobots — were ranked in the 50-200 transformation range and never received deep analytical attention.",
      "fix_applied": "Actionable top 20 (geometric mean) now prioritizes these models. v3-9 should deep-dive physical economy sectors."

      "blind_spot": "Category system didn't surface 'accessible but uncertain' models",

      "impact": "Models in fragmented, wide-open markets with moderate transformation certainty were invisible. Some of these may be the most practical opportunities — lower conviction but wide open.",

      "evidence": "0% of vertical_saas models (0 of 36) are WIDE_OPEN. The heuristic captures this but the 5-axis system didn't. SaaS markets are already crowded or quickly become so.",
      "impact": "Multiple SaaS-architecture models scored 70-80 on transformation but are CONTESTED on opportunity. The engine overweighted their structural inevitability without pricing in competitive density.",
      "fix_applied": "CLA correctly classifies most SaaS as ACCESSIBLE (viable but competitive) rather than WIDE_OPEN."
