Micro-firm AI OS enables: (a) aging owners to run their businesses longer with AI augmentation, (b) successors to operate acquired businesses with fewer staff, (c) AI-augmented micro-firms to acquire Silver Tsunami businesses and modernize them.",
      "P_027_staffing_canary": "If staffing companies are dying because AI replaces human intermediation, micro-firms benefit doubly: they do not need to hire through staffing (AI does the work) AND they can serve the clients that staffing companies used to serve (through micro-firm marketplace).",
