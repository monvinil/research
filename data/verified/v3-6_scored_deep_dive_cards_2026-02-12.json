      "defense_premium": "Defense cards average 74.8 composite vs 71.6 (v35) and 68.9 (education). This premium is driven by: (1) $13.4B dedicated budget insulated from economic cycles, (2) regulatory moats (ITAR, FedRAMP, CMMC, clearances) that protect first movers, (3) low fear friction (buyers WANT AI), and (4) geopolitical urgency creating counter-cyclical demand.",
      "education_discount": "Education cards average 68.9 — lowest of the three sources. This discount is entirely explained by fear friction: education has the LARGEST gap between economic readiness and psychological readiness (gap = 5). The corporate/professional channel (CORP-01: 74.5, TEACH-01: 72.25, CERT-01: 71.0, FEAR-01: 72.25) scores well; the consumer/student-facing channel (TUTOR-01: 62.25) scores lowest due to parental fear.",

The financial services models (5239-001: 78.75, 5259-001: 77.25, 5223-001: 78.5) score highest due to 73% AI adoption (lowest friction) + Baumol scores of 2-3.6x + counter-cyclical demand. The marketplace models (5417-002: 64.75) and discretionary consulting model (5416-001: 63.75) score lowest due to cold-start risk and cyclical demand."

The highest new card (MC-DEF-011: 82.5) would rank in the top 8 of the entire 293-model inventory if it met the SN >= 9.0 threshold. The new cards' mean of 71.7 aligns with the existing inventory mean of 63.1 — the deep dive cards score above average because they were specifically selected for sector depth and architectural specificity, unlike the broad enumeration that includes many thin/speculative models.",
      "distribution_health": "0 STRUCTURAL_WINNER (expected: 0-1 per batch of 32), 21 FORCE_RIDER (66% — higher than inventory average of 23% due to deep dive selection bias toward high-quality sectors), 10 CONDITIONAL (31% — vs 43% in inventory), 0 PARKED (all deep dive cards are above 60.0 threshold by construction — they were selected for being promising sectors)."
