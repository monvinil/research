  "executive_summary": "Entry-level hiring is collapsing across the US economy at a pace and breadth that exceeds any cyclical downturn. The 67% junior developer decline is the most visible signal, but the phenomenon spans professional services, financial services, management, healthcare administration, and education. This is not a hiring freeze -- it is a structural redefinition of how organizations build talent. The cascade chain runs: entry-level extinction (2024-2027) -> skill pipeline collapse (2027-2029) -> leadership vacuum (2029-2033) -> organizational capability degradation (2031-2036). The 5-10 year lag between pipeline destruction and leadership shortage means decisions made in 2025-2026 will manifest as an acute senior talent crisis in 2031-2036, precisely when AI-augmented organizations need experienced human judgment the most. Counter-forces exist (AI-accelerated training, apprenticeship revival, credential reform) but none operate at the scale or speed needed to close the gap. The most likely outcome is a barbell labor market: a small cohort of AI-native professionals who navigated the transition successfully commanding extreme premiums, alongside a large cohort locked out of traditional career paths entirely.",

  "core_thesis": {
    "statement": "The entry-level extinction is structural, not cyclical. It is driven by three reinforcing mechanisms: (1) AI substitution of routine cognitive tasks that historically defined entry-level roles, (2) anticipatory displacement where firms cut junior headcount based on AI's POTENTIAL rather than proven performance (P-036: 60% cut for potential, 2% for actual implementation), and (3) a preference cascade where managers who observe peers replacing juniors with AI feel compelled to follow. The structural nature means recovery of traditional entry-level hiring is unlikely even in a strong economy.",

    "theoretical_basis": ["T1 Schumpeterian Creative Destruction", "T3 Baumol Cost Disease (Cure)", "T10 Coasean Transaction Costs", "T25 Fear Economics"],
    "key_distinction": "Cyclical hiring freezes preserve the ROLE while reducing the NUMBER of hires. Structural extinction eliminates the ROLE itself. When AI can do 60-70% of what a junior analyst, junior developer, or first-year associate did, the role does not come back when the economy improves -- it is permanently redefined or eliminated."
