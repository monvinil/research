(3) AI tutoring captures the Baumol cure opportunity (30-50x cost reduction) but faces highest fear friction. (4) Professional cert prep captures the pipeline crisis (CPA -33%, nursing shortage). (5) Skills matching replaces the collapsing staffing intermediation layer. (6) University admin captures survival-driven demand (demographic cliff).

    "key_insight": "Education's fear friction gap (5 points) is the defining strategic variable. Financial services (gap 1) moves fast. Healthcare (gap 3) moves through the invisible pathway. Education (gap 5) requires the MOST careful trust architecture. The winning strategy is to enter through low-friction channels (corporate training, teacher tools) and ride the trust cascade down to high-friction channels (student-facing tutoring) over 3-5 years."
