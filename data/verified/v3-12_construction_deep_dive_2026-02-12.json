Current digital solutions: ISNetworld (safety-focused, $200M+ revenue, dominant in industrial), Avetta (supply chain risk, broader than construction), TradeTapp (construction-specific prequal, acquired by Procore competitor Command Alkon). Procore has basic prequal features but not AI-driven risk scoring. The AI opportunity: automatically pull OSHA records, financial filings, insurance certificates, litigation history, project performance data, and generate a real-time risk score for any subcontractor. The compounding data moat is strong: each prequal assessment adds to the database, and GCs who use the platform want ALL their subs on it, creating network effects.

Subcontractor selection is the single highest-risk decision a GC makes. Subcontractor failure (bankruptcy mid-project, abandonment, defective work requiring rework) causes an estimated $15B+ in annual project disruptions (based on construction defect litigation data, surety bond claims, and project delay costs). Current prequal process: manual, paper-based, requiring 5-20 hours per sub per project. GCs typically prequalify 100-500 subs per year. Data sources available for AI aggregation: (1) OSHA inspection records (public), (2) State contractor license status (public), (3) Financial health indicators (D&B, Experian commercial), (4) Insurance certificate verification (API-accessible), (5) Litigation history (court records), (6) Project performance references (proprietary). ISNetworld dominates industrial prequal ($200M+ revenue) but is weak in commercial/residential construction. A construction-specific prequal platform with AI risk scoring could charge $5-15K/year per GC and $500-1,500/year per sub (sub pays to maintain verified profile). Network effects: GCs want all subs on platform, subs want to be findable by all GCs.",
