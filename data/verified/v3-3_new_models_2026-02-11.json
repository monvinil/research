This approach could not detect: (1) Defense AI — crosses multiple NAICS codes and requires geopolitical context; (2) Fear economy — market created by psychology, not by sector economics; (3) Energy infrastructure services — sits between NAICS codes (construction, utilities, consulting); (4) Geographic-specific models — v2 was US-centric; (5) Emerging categories — no NAICS code exists yet; (6) Cross-sector patterns that only become visible at the economy-map level.",
    "construction_discipline": "Every model has concrete unit economics (not 'large TAM'). Every model cites specific force mechanisms (not 'AI disrupts X'). Every model lists testable assumptions in what_must_be_true. Scoring is calibrated against existing v3-2 rated models (MC-52-001 at 83.0 is the benchmark).",
