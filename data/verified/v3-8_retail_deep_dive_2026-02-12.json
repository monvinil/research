    "headline": "NAICS 44-45 is the largest private-sector employer in the US economy (15.53M workers, 1.07M establishments) and the sector where AI automation meets the average American worker. Retail wages ($791/wk, $41,140 annual) are 43% below the economy average ($1,392/wk), creating LOW Baumol stored energy (0.57 score) but MASSIVE absolute scale for transformation. The sector is bifurcating: e-commerce (16.4-18% of sales, growing) versus physical retail (800+ closures announced 2026) with an emerging third category -- AI-augmented omnichannel -- absorbing both. Retail media networks ($69B in 2026) are creating a new profit layer that subsidizes consumer-facing losses. Dollar stores expanding (450+ new DG stores in 2026) while department stores and specialty retail contract. Self-checkout adoption at 87% of consumers, cashierless market growing 13.7% CAGR. Warehouse automation ($181B by 2031) and micro-fulfillment ($10B by 2026) are restructuring the back-end while front-end labor displacement concentrates on entry-level, young, female, and minority workers -- the most politically sensitive displacement in the economy.",

    "2026": "CURRENT STATE: Retail bifurcation accelerates. 800+ announced store closures (Saks Off 5th, Carter's, Macy's locations) concentrate in apparel and department stores. Dollar stores expand 750+ new locations. E-commerce reaches 17-18% of total retail. Self-checkout at 87% consumer adoption. Amazon passes $700B revenue. Retail media networks hit $69B. Micro-fulfillment centers reach $10B cumulative deployment. First widespread AI pricing tools (dynamic markdown, demand-responsive) deployed by top-20 retailers. Cashier roles begin measurable decline in grocery and general merchandise. Tariffs ($1,300/household) compress consumer spending, accelerating shift to discount formats. Humanoid robotics (warehouse) in pilot at Walmart, Amazon facilities.",
    "2027": "ACCELERATION: AI checkout and inventory automation move from pilot to standard in top-50 retailers. Self-checkout kiosks with AI vision (no scanning) deploy at scale, reducing cashier demand by 10-15% at adopting stores. Warehouse automation reaches critical mass -- Symbotic-type systems operational in 200+ fulfillment centers. Retail media becomes majority of profit for Amazon and Walmart grocery operations. First AI-native retail formats emerge (fully automated convenience stores in urban cores). Dollar store/discount format becomes default for 25%+ of US consumer spending. Grocery delivery/BOPIS (buy online pick up in store) exceeds 20% of grocery sales. Department store closures accelerate -- Macy's, Nordstrom, JCPenney further shrink footprints. Net retail employment begins measurable decline (-50K to -100K annual).",
    "2028": "BIFURCATION CRYSTALLIZES: Retail splits into three distinct employment tiers: (1) High-automation warehouse/fulfillment (fewer workers, higher wages), (2) Experience retail (cosmetics, pet, sporting goods -- growing but small), (3) AI-augmented mass retail (grocery, general merchandise -- same stores, fewer workers). Cashierless/scan-and-go becomes standard at grocery chains. AI demand forecasting reduces overstock waste by 20-30%, compressing need for markdown/clearance operations. Recommerce reaches 15%+ of clothing sales. EV transition begins visible impact on gas station economics in coastal markets. Humanoid robots operational in 500+ warehouses. Net retail employment down 200-300K from 2026 peak.",
    "2029": "LABOR MARKET IMPACT PEAK: Cumulative retail job losses reach 500K-700K from 2026 baseline. Grocery automation matures -- average supermarket operates with 30% fewer workers than 2025. Pharmacy closures plateau as remaining CVS/Walgreens reinvent as healthcare hubs. AI visual merchandising and store layout optimization standard. Retail becomes politically contested -- state-level legislation to protect cashier jobs emerges (similar to NJ gas pump attendant laws). Rural retail deserts expand as dollar stores and online replace traditional Main Street retail. Last-mile delivery automation (drones, autonomous vehicles) begins material deployment in suburban markets.",
    "2030": "NEW EQUILIBRIUM EMERGING: Retail employment stabilizes at ~14M (down ~1.5M from 2023 peak) as new AI-augmented roles partially offset automation losses. Warehouse clubs/supercenters have fully automated back-of-store operations. E-commerce reaches 25%+ of total retail. Retail media networks exceed $120B. Physical stores that survive are 'experience + pickup' hybrid models. Department store format largely extinct outside luxury tier. Dollar stores peak and begin their own automation cycle. Grocery dark stores and micro-fulfillment serve 30%+ of urban grocery demand.",
    "2031": "STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE: Retail is a fundamentally different sector -- fewer workers ($14M vs $15.5M), higher wages for remaining workers ($50K+ vs $41K), more automated, more concentrated. Amazon, Walmart, Costco control 40%+ of total retail sales. Independent retail survives in experience niches (pet, sporting goods, specialty food) and dollar/discount. The 1.5M displaced workers have distributed to healthcare (~400K), warehouse/logistics (~300K), gig economy (~200K), and structural unemployment/underemployment (~600K).

Amazon and Walmart adding warehouse capacity while reducing per-facility headcount. Net absorption limited to 300K, and these jobs are often worse conditions than retail (injury rates, schedules). Humanoid robotics (v38-S40) threatens this absorption channel by 2029-2030.",
    "gig_economy_absorption": "150K-250K. Delivery driving (DoorDash, Instacart, Amazon Flex) absorbs some displaced retail workers but at lower total compensation (no benefits, variable hours).

    "remaining_retail_reabsorption": "200K-300K. Growing retail segments (dollar stores, pet, cosmetics/experience retail, cannabis) absorb some displaced workers. Dollar General adding 450+ stores/year creates ~15K-20K jobs annually. But these are often lower-wage than jobs lost.",
    "structural_unemployment": "300K-600K. The uncomfortable truth: a significant fraction of displaced retail workers will not find equivalent employment. Without college degrees and with limited technical skills, many face permanent downward mobility or withdrawal from labor force.

    "net_displacement_estimate": "At 15.53M current workers, even a 10% displacement (1.55M) over 5 years is 310K per year -- more than twice the monthly job creation rate of the entire economy in 2025 (15K/month revised). This displacement will be partially masked by natural attrition (high turnover sector, 60%+ annual turnover) but the JOBS will not be recreated as workers leave.",
    "demographic_equity_impact": "Retail displacement is regressive: it falls hardest on workers least equipped to transition. Hispanic women (overrepresented in grocery), young Black workers (overrepresented in general merchandise), and rural workers (limited alternatives) bear disproportionate burden.

  "synthesis": "Retail Trade (NAICS 44-45) is the largest private employer in the US economy and faces the most politically sensitive AI-driven transformation of any sector. Unlike financial services (high Baumol, concentrated displacement on affluent workers) or healthcare (growing, absorbing workers), retail represents AI meeting the average American worker. The transformation is real but nuanced: (1) E-commerce continues steady growth but physical retail retains 75%+ share through 2031; (2) The real transformation is INSIDE physical stores -- fewer workers per store, AI-optimized operations, self-checkout as default; (3) Retail media networks are creating a new profit layer that changes who captures value in retail; (4) Dollar stores and discount formats grow while department stores and specialty retail contract; (5) 1.2-1.8M net jobs eliminated by 2031, concentrated among young, female, minority, and rural workers; (6) This displacement has limited absorption pathways -- healthcare is bottlenecked, warehouse is also automating, gig economy is precarious. The central insight: retail's low Baumol score (0.57) means the disruption is driven by LABOR SUBSTITUTION at scale, not by curing high-cost inefficiency. This makes retail the opposite of the engine's typical high-Baumol targets -- but the absolute scale (15.5M workers, $639B annual wages) means even small percentage improvements create massive value and massive displacement simultaneously."
