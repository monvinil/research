    "headline": "NAICS 53 is the economy's primary SECOND-ORDER CASCADE RECEPTOR: the financial services meltdown (P-026, office CMBS 12.34% all-time record), remote work structural shift, and AI workforce reduction all converge on real estate simultaneously. The sector's extreme fragmentation (488K establishments, avg 4.9 workers -- MOST fragmented major sector in the economy) creates both massive vulnerability and massive consolidation opportunity. Commercial real estate faces a $936B debt maturity wall in 2026 with office values 35-50% below 2020 peaks. Residential faces commission restructuring (NAR settlement) and AI agent intermediation. This is not one disruption -- it is a multi-front structural repricing of how physical space is valued, transacted, and managed in an economy that needs less office space, different residential patterns, and AI-automated property operations.",

    "key_observation": "The real estate sector's model cards are dominated by TIMING_ARBITRAGE (3 of top 5 cards) because the CRE debt maturity wall creates a TIME-BOUNDED opportunity window. This distinguishes RE from other sectors where FORCE_RIDER dominates. The highest-scoring card (MC-RE-006, 81.5) is an advisory model that PROFITS FROM fear rather than overcoming it -- the CRE distress IS the demand driver. No STRUCTURAL_WINNER cards because real estate lacks the 'must exist regardless of market conditions' dynamic that defense or AI governance have. The sector's transformation is STRUCTURAL but the specific business models are time-dependent."
