  "executive_summary": "The Financial Services to Commercial Real Estate cascade is a 6-link transmission chain already in motion, with the first 2 links confirmed by hard data and links 3-6 projected with high-to-medium confidence. Office CMBS delinquency at 12.34% (all-time record, 1.6pp above the 2008 Financial Crisis peak) is the observable leading indicator. Bank CRE delinquency at 1.2% is a lagging indicator obscured by extend-and-pretend -- the gap MUST close as $936B in CRE debt matures in 2026. The cascade transmits through 6 links: (1) FS AI adoption reduces office demand, (2) CMBS distress crystallizes first, (3) bank extend-and-pretend exhausts, (4) regional bank stress forces credit tightening, (5) small business credit contraction, (6) employment and fiscal effects. Total value at risk: $500B-$800B in office CRE alone, with $200B-$400B in second-order banking and credit effects. This is NOT a 2008-style systemic crisis -- it is a Schumpeterian rotation channeled through the CRE credit system. The key distinction: 2008 was residential, levered 30:1, with counterparty risk across the entire financial system. 2026 is office, concentrated in regional banks, with higher capital ratios, and the destruction is OFFSET by AI-driven value creation in other sectors.",

The critical distinction: 2008 destroyed demand that was REAL (people wanted houses); 2026 reprices demand that has PERMANENTLY SHIFTED (people will not return to offices 5 days/week).
